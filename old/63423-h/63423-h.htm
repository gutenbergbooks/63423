<h3>
  A TRIBUTE.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  More human, more divine than we&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In truth, half human, half divine&mdash;<br />
  Is woman, when good stars agree<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To temper with their beams benign<br />
  The hour of her nativity.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The fairest flower the green earth bears,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright with the dew and light of heaven,<br />
  Is, of the double life she wears,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The type, in grace and glory given<br />
  By soil and sun in equal shares.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  True sister of the Son of Man:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True sister of the Son of God:<br />
  What marvel that she leads the van<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those who in the path he trod,<br />
  Still bear the cross and wear the ban?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  If God be in the sky and sea,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And live in light and ride the storm,<br />
  Then God is God, although He be<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enshrined within a woman's form;<br />
  And claims glad reverence from me.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So, as I worship Him in Christ,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the Forms of Earth and Air,<br />
  I worship Him imparadised,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And throned within her bosom fair<br />
  Whom vanity hath not enticed.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O! woman&mdash;mother!  Woman&mdash;wife!&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweetest names that language knows!<br />
  Thy breast, with holy motives rife,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With holiest affection glows,<br />
  Thou queen, thou angel of my life!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Noble and fine in his degree<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the best man my heart receives;<br />
  And this my heart's supremest plea<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him: he feels, acts, lives, believes,<br />
  And seems, and is, the likest thee.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O men!  O brothers!  Well I know<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That with her nature in our souls<br />
  Is born the elemental woe&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brutal impulse that controls,<br />
  And drives, or drags, the godlike low.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ambition, appetite and pride&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These throng and thrall the hearts of men<br />
  These plat the thorns, and pierce the side<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Him, who, in our souls again,<br />
  Is spit upon, and crucified.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The greed for gain, the thirst for power,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lust that blackens while it burns:<br />
  Ah! these the whitest souls deflour!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one, or all of these by turns,<br />
  Rob man of his divinest dower!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Yet man, who shivers like a straw<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Temptation's lightest breeze,<br />
  Assumes the master&mdash;gives the law<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To her who, on her bended knees,<br />
  Resists the black-winged thunder-flaw!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  To him who deems her weak and vain,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And boasts his own exceeding might,<br />
  She clings through darkest fortune fain;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still loyal though the ruffian smite;<br />
  Still true, though crime his hands distain!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And is this weakness?  Is it not<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of God, that loves and bears<br />
  Though He be slighted or forgot<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In damning crimes, or driving cares,<br />
  And closest clings in darkest lot?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Not many friends my life has made;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few have I loved, and few are they<br />
  Who in my hand their hearts have laid;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these were women.  I am gray,<br />
  But never have I been betrayed.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  These words&mdash;this tribute&mdash;for the sake<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of truth to God and womankind!<br />
  These&mdash;that my heart may cease to ache<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With love and gratitude confined,<br />
  And burning from my lips to break!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  These&mdash;to that sisterhood of grace<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That numbers in its sacred list<br />
  My mother, risen to her place;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife, but yester-morning kissed,<br />
  And folded in Love's last embrace!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  This tribute of a love profound<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ever moved the heart of man,<br />
  To those to whom my life is bound,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To her in whom my life began,<br />
  And her whose love my life hath crowned!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Immortal Love!  Thou still hast wings<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lift me to those radiant fields,<br />
  Where Music waits with trembling strings,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Verse her happy numbers yields,<br />
  And all the soul within me sings.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So from the lovely Pagan dream<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call no more the Tuneful Nine;<br />
  For Woman is my Muse Supreme;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she with fire and flight divine,<br />
  Shall light and lead me to my theme.<br />
</p>

  PART I.

<h3>
  CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Thou lovely vale of sweetest stream that flows:<br />
  Winding and willow-fringed Connecticut!<br />
  Swift to thy fairest scenes my fancy flies,<br />
  As I recall the story of a life<br />
  Which there began in years of sinless hope,<br />
  And merged maturely into hopeless sin.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O! golden dawning of a day of storms,<br />
  That fell ere noontide into rayless night!<br />
  O! beautiful initial, vermeil-flowered,<br />
  And bright with cherub-eyes and effigies,<br />
  To the black-letter volume of my life!<br />
  O! faëry gateway, gilt and garlanded,<br />
  And shining in the sun, to gloomy groves<br />
  Of shadowy cypress, and to sunless streams,<br />
  Feeding with bane the deadly nightshade's roots,&mdash;<br />
  To vexing labyrinths of doubt and fear,<br />
  And deep abysses of despair and death!<br />
  Back to thy peaceful villages and fields,<br />
  My memory, like a weary pilgrim, comes<br />
  With scrip and burdon, to repose awhile,&mdash;<br />
  To pluck a daisy from a lonely grave<br />
  Where long ago, in common sepulture,<br />
  I laid my mother and my faith in God;<br />
  To fix the record of a single day<br />
  So memorably wonderful and sweet<br />
  Its power of inspiration lingers still,&mdash;<br />
  So full of her dear presence, so divine<br />
  With the melodious breathing of her words,<br />
  And the warm radiance of her loving smile,<br />
  That tears fall readily as April rain<br />
  At its recall; to pass in swift review<br />
  The years of adolescence, and the paths<br />
  Of glare and gloom through which, by passion led<br />
  I reached the fair possession of my power,<br />
  And won the dear possession of my love,<br />
  And then&mdash;farewell!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen-village of the meads<br />
  Fronting the sunrise and in beauty throned,<br />
  With jewelled homes around her lifted brow,<br />
  And coronal of ancient forest trees&mdash;<br />
  Northampton sits, and rules her pleasant realm.<br />
  There where the saintly Edwards heralded<br />
  The terrors of the Lord, and men bowed low<br />
  Beneath the menace of his awful words;<br />
  And there where Nature, with a thousand tongues<br />
  Tender and true, from vale and mountain-top,<br />
  And smiling streams, and landscapes piled afar,<br />
  Proclaimed a gentler Gospel, I was born.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In an old home, beneath an older elm&mdash;<br />
  A fount of weeping greenery, that dripped<br />
  Its spray of rain and dew upon the roof&mdash;<br />
  I opened eyes on life; and now return,<br />
  Among the visions of my early years,<br />
  Two so distinct that all the rest grow dim:<br />
  My mother's pale, fond face and tearful eyes,<br />
  Bent upon me in Love's absorbing trance,<br />
  From the low window where she watched my play;<br />
  And, after this, the wondrous elm, that seemed<br />
  To my young fancy like an airy bosk,<br />
  Poised by a single stem upon the earth,<br />
  And thronged by instant marvels.  There in Spring<br />
  I heard with joy the cheery blue-bird's note;<br />
  There sang rejoicing robins after rain;<br />
  And there within the emerald twilight, which<br />
  Defied the mid-day sun, from bough to bough&mdash;<br />
  A torch of downy flame&mdash;the oriole<br />
  Passed to his nest, to feed the censer-fires<br />
  Which Love had lit for Airs of Heaven to swing.<br />
  There, too, through all the weird September-eves<br />
  I heard the harsh, reiterant katydids<br />
  Rasp the mysterious silence.  There I watched<br />
  The glint of stars, playing at hide-and-seek<br />
  Behind the swaying foliage, till drawn<br />
  By tender hands to childhood's balmy rest.<br />
  My Mother and the elm!  Too soon I learned<br />
  That o'er me hung, and o'er the widowed one<br />
  Who gave me birth, with broader boughs,<br />
  Haunted by sabler wings and sadder sounds,<br />
  A darker shadow than the mighty elm!<br />
  I caught the secret in the street from those<br />
  Who pointed at me as I passed, or paused<br />
  To gaze in sighing pity on my play;<br />
  From playmates who, forbidden to divulge<br />
  The knowledge they possessed, with childish tricks<br />
  Of indirection strove in vain to hide<br />
  Their awful meaning in unmeaning phrase;<br />
  From kisses which were pitiful; from words<br />
  Gentler than love's because compassionate;<br />
  From deep, unconscious sighs out of the heart<br />
  Of her who loved me best, and from her tears<br />
  That freest flowed when I was happiest.<br />
  From frailest filaments of evidence,<br />
  From dark allusions faintly overheard,<br />
  From hint and look and sudden change of theme<br />
  When I approached, from widely scattered words<br />
  Remembered well, and gathered all at length<br />
  Into consistent terms, I know not how<br />
  I wrought the full conclusion, nor how young.<br />
  I only know that when a little child<br />
  I learned, though no one told, that he who gave<br />
  My life to me in madness took his own&mdash;<br />
  Took it from fear of want, though he possessed<br />
  The finest fortune in the rich old town.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Thenceforth I had a secret which I kept&mdash;<br />
  Kept by my mother with as close a tongue&mdash;<br />
  A secret which embittered every cup.<br />
  It bred rebellion in me&mdash;filled my soul,<br />
  Opening to life in innocent delight,<br />
  With baleful doubt and harrowing distrust.<br />
  Why, if my father was the godly man<br />
  His gentle widow vouched with tender tears,<br />
  Did He to whom she bowed in daily prayer&mdash;<br />
  Who loved us, as she told me, with a love<br />
  Ineffable for strength and tenderness&mdash;<br />
  Permit such fate to him, such woe to us?<br />
  Ah! many a time, repeating on my knees<br />
  The simple language of my evening prayer<br />
  Which her dear lips had taught me, came the dark<br />
  Perplexing question, stirring in my heart<br />
  A sense of guilt, or quenching all my faith.<br />
  This, too, I kept a secret.  I had died<br />
  Rather than breathe the question in her ears<br />
  Who knelt beside me.  I had rather died<br />
  Than add a sorrow to the load she bore.<br />
  Taught to be true, I played the hypocrite<br />
  In truthfulness to her.  I had no God,<br />
  Nor penitence, nor loyalty nor love;<br />
  For any being higher than herself.<br />
  Jealous of all to whom she gave her hand,<br />
  I clung to her with fond idolatry.<br />
  I sat with her; where'er she walked, I walked<br />
  I kissed away her tears; I strove to fill,<br />
  With strange precocity of manly pride<br />
  And more than boyish tenderness, the void<br />
  Which death had made.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not fail to see<br />
  That ruth for me and sorrow for her loss&mdash;<br />
  Twin leeches at her heart&mdash;were drinking blood<br />
  That, from her pallid features, day by day<br />
  Sank slowly down, to feed the cruel draught.<br />
  Nay, more than this I saw, and sadly worse.<br />
  Oft when I watched her and she knew it not,<br />
  I marked a quivering horror sweep her face&mdash;<br />
  A strange, quick thrill of pain&mdash;that brought her hand<br />
  With sudden pressure to her heart, and forced<br />
  To her white lips a swiftly whispered prayer.<br />
  I fancied that I read the mystery;<br />
  But it was deeper and more terrible<br />
  Than I conjectured.  Not till darker years<br />
  Came the solution.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, we had some days<br />
  Of pleasure.  Sorrow cannot always brood<br />
  Over the shivering forms that drink her warmth;<br />
  But springs to meet the morning light, and soars<br />
  Into the empyrean, to forget<br />
  For one sweet hour the ring of greedy mouths<br />
  That surely wait, and cry for her return.<br />
  My mother's hand in mine, or mine in hers,<br />
  We often left the village far behind,<br />
  And walked the meadow-paths to gather flowers,<br />
  And watch the plowman as he turned the tilth,<br />
  Or tossed his burnished share into the sun<br />
  At the long furrow's end, the while we marked<br />
  The tipsy bobolink, struggling with the chain<br />
  Of tinkling music that perplexed his wings,<br />
  And listened to the yellow-breasted lark's<br />
  Sweet whistle from the grass.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glad in my joy,<br />
  My mother smiled amid these scenes and sounds,<br />
  And wandered on with gentle step and slow,<br />
  While I, in boyish frolic, ran before,<br />
  Chasing the butterflies, or in her path<br />
  Tossing the gaudy gold of buttercups,<br />
  Till sometimes, ere we knew, we stood entranced<br />
  Upon the river's marge.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever the spell<br />
  Of lapsing water tamed my playful mood,<br />
  And I reclined in silent happiness<br />
  At the tired feet that rested in the shade.<br />
  There through the long, bright mornings we remained,<br />
  Watching the noisy ferry-boat that plied<br />
  Like a slow shuttle through the sunny warp<br />
  Of threaded silver from a thousand brooks,<br />
  That took new beauty as it wound away;<br />
  Or gazing where at Holyoke's verdant base&mdash;<br />
  Like a slim hound, stretched at his master's feet&mdash;<br />
  Lay the long, lazy hamlet, Hockanum;<br />
  Or, upward turning, traced the line that climbed<br />
  O'er splintered rock and clustered foliage<br />
  To the bare mountain-top; then followed down<br />
  The scars of fire and storm, or paths of gloom<br />
  That marked the curtained gorges, till, at last,<br />
  Caught by a wisp of white, belated mist,<br />
  Our vision rose to trace its airy flight<br />
  Beyond the height, into the distant blue.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  One morning, while we rested there, she told<br />
  Of a dear friend upon the other side&mdash;<br />
  A lady who had loved her&mdash;whom she loved&mdash;<br />
  And then she promised to my eager wish<br />
  That soon, across the stream I longed to pass,<br />
  I should go with her to the lady's home.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The wishedfor day came slowly&mdash;came at last&mdash;<br />
  My birthday morning&mdash;rounding to their close<br />
  The fourteen summers of my boyhood's life.<br />
  The early mists were clinging to the side<br />
  Of the dark mountain as we left the town,<br />
  Though all the roadside fields were quick with toil<br />
  In rhythmic motion through the dewy grass<br />
  The mowers swept, and on the fragrant air<br />
  Was borne from far the soft, metallic clash<br />
  Of stones upon the steel.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the day<br />
  "So memorably wonderful and sweet<br />
  Its power of inspiration lingers still,&mdash;<br />
  So full of her dear presence, so divine<br />
  With the melodious breathing of her words,<br />
  And the warm radiance of her loving smile,<br />
  That tears fall readily as April rain<br />
  At its recall."  And with this day there came<br />
  The revelation and the genesis<br />
  Of a new life.  In intellect and heart<br />
  I ceased to be a child, and grew a man.<br />
  By one long leap I passed the hidden bound<br />
  That circumscribed my boyhood, and thenceforth<br />
  Abjured all childish pleasure, and took on<br />
  The purpose and the burden of my life.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We crossed the river&mdash;I, as in a dream;<br />
  And when I stood upon the eastern shore,<br />
  In the full presence of the mountain pile,<br />
  Strange tides of feeling thrilled me, and I wept&mdash;<br />
  Wept, though I knew not why.  I could have knelt<br />
  On the white sand, and prayed.  Within my soul<br />
  Prophetic whispers breathed of coming power<br />
  And new possessions.  Aspiration swelled<br />
  Like a pent stream within a narrow chasm,<br />
  That finds nor vent nor overflow, but swirls<br />
  And surges and retreats, until it floods<br />
  The springs that feed it.  All was chaos wild,&mdash;<br />
  A chaos of fresh passion, undefined,<br />
  Deep in whose vortices of mist and fire<br />
  A new world waited blindly for its birth.<br />
  I had no words for revelation;&mdash;none<br />
  For answer, when my mother pressed my hand,<br />
  And questioned why it trembled.  I looked up<br />
  With tearful eyes, and met her loving smile,<br />
  And both of us were silent, and passed on.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We reached at length the pleasant cottage-home<br />
  Where dwelt my mother's friend, and, at the gate,<br />
  Found her with warmest welcome waiting us.<br />
  She kissed my mother's cheek, and then kissed mine,<br />
  Which shrank, and mantled with a new-born shame.<br />
  They crossed the threshold: I remained without.<br />
  Surprised&mdash;half-angry&mdash;with the burning blush<br />
  That still o'erwhelmed my face.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked around<br />
  For something to divert my vexing thoughts,<br />
  And saw intently gazing in my eyes,<br />
  From his long tether in the grass, a lamb&mdash;<br />
  A lusty, downy, handsome, household pet.<br />
  There was a scarlet ribbon on his neck<br />
  Which held a silver bell, whose note I heard<br />
  First when his eye met mine; for then he sprang<br />
  To greet me with a joyous bleat, and fell,<br />
  Thrown by the cord that held him.  Pitying him,<br />
  I loosed his cruel leashing, with intent,<br />
  After a half-hour's frolic, to return<br />
  And fasten as I found him; but my hand,<br />
  Too careless of its charge, slipped from its hold<br />
  With the first bound he made; and with a leap<br />
  He cleared the garden wall, and flew away.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Affrighted at my deed and its mischance,<br />
  I paused a moment&mdash;then with ready feet,<br />
  And first and final impulse, I pursued.<br />
  He held the pathway to the mountain woods,<br />
  The tinkle of his bell already faint<br />
  In the long distance he had placed between<br />
  Himself and his pursuer.  On and on,<br />
  Climbing the mountain path, he sped away,<br />
  I following swiftly, never losing sight<br />
  Of the bright scarlet streaming from his neck,<br />
  Or hearing of the tinkle of his bell,<br />
  Till, wearied both, and panting up the steep,<br />
  Our progress slackened to a walk.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At length<br />
  He paused and looked at me, and waited till<br />
  My foot had touched the cord he dragged, and then<br />
  Bounded away, scaling the shelvy cliffs<br />
  That bolder rose along the narrow path.<br />
  He had no choice but mount.  I pressed him close,<br />
  And rocks and chasms were thick on either side;<br />
  So, pausing oft, but ever leaping on<br />
  Before my hand could reach him, he advanced.<br />
  Not once in all the passage had I paused<br />
  To look below, nor had I thought of her<br />
  Whom I had left.  Absorbed in the pursuit<br />
  I pressed it recklessly, until I grasped<br />
  My fleecy prisoner, wound and tied his cord<br />
  Around my wrist, and both of us sank down<br />
  Upon the mountain summit.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a swoon<br />
  Of breathless weariness how long I lay<br />
  I could not know; but consciousness at last<br />
  Came by my brute companion, who, alert<br />
  Among the scanty browse, tugged at my wrist,<br />
  And brought me startled to my feet.  I saw<br />
  In one swift sweep of vision where I stood,&mdash;<br />
  In presence of what beauty of the earth,<br />
  What glory of the sky, what majesty<br />
  Of lofty loneliness.  I drew the lamb&mdash;<br />
  The dear, dumb creature&mdash;gently to my side,<br />
  And led him out upon the beetling cliff<br />
  That fronts the plaided meadows, and knelt down.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When once the shrinking, dizzy spell was gone,<br />
  I saw below me, like a jewelled cup,<br />
  The valley hollowed to its heaven-kissed lip&mdash;<br />
  The serrate green against the serrate blue&mdash;<br />
  Brimming with beauty's essence; palpitant<br />
  With a divine elixir&mdash;lucent floods<br />
  Poured from the golden chalice of the sun,<br />
  At which my spirit drank with conscious growth,<br />
  And drank again with still expanding scope<br />
  Of comprehension and of faculty.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I felt the bud of being in me burst<br />
  With full, unfolding petals to a rose,<br />
  And fragrant breath that flooded all the scene.<br />
  By sudden insight of myself I knew<br />
  That I was greater than the scene,&mdash;that deep<br />
  Within my nature was a wondrous world,<br />
  Broader than that I gazed on, and informed<br />
  With a diviner beauty,&mdash;that the things<br />
  I saw were but the types of those I held,<br />
  And that above them both, High Priest and King,<br />
  I stood supreme, to choose and to combine,<br />
  And build from that within me and without<br />
  New forms of life, with meaning of my own.<br />
  And there alone, upon the mountain-top,<br />
  Kneeling beside the lamb, I bowed my head<br />
  Beneath the chrismal light, and felt my soul<br />
  Baptized and set apart to poetry.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The spell of inspiration lingered not;<br />
  But ere it passed, I knew my destiny&mdash;<br />
  The passion and the portion of my life:<br />
  Though, with the new-born consciousness of power<br />
  And organizing and creative skill,<br />
  There came a sense of poverty&mdash;a sense<br />
  Of power untrained, of skill without resource,<br />
  Of ignorance of Nature and her laws<br />
  And language and the learning of the schools.<br />
  I could not rise upon my callow wings,<br />
  But felt that I must wait until the years<br />
  Should give them plumage, and the skill for flight<br />
  Be won by trial.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then before me rose<br />
  The long, long years of study, interposed<br />
  Between me and the goal that shone afar;<br />
  But with them rose the courage to surmount,<br />
  And I was girt for toil.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, for the first,<br />
  My eye and spirit that had drunk the whole<br />
  Wide vision, grew discriminate, and traced<br />
  The crystal river pouring from the North<br />
  Its twinkling tide, and winding down the vale,<br />
  Till, doubling in a serpent coil, it paused<br />
  Before the chasm that parts the frontal spurs<br />
  Of Tom and Holyoke; then in wreathing light<br />
  Sped the swart rocks, and sought the misty South.<br />
  Across the meadows&mdash;carpet for the gods,<br />
  Woven of ripening rye and greening maize<br />
  And rosy clover-blooms, and spotted o'er<br />
  With the black shadows of the feathery elms&mdash;<br />
  Northampton rose, half hidden in her trees,<br />
  Lifted above the level of the fields,<br />
  And noiseless as a picture.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At my feet<br />
  The ferry-boat, diminished to a toy,<br />
  With automatic diligence conveyed<br />
  Its puppet passengers between the shores<br />
  That hemmed its enterprise; and one low barge,<br />
  With white, square sail, bore northward languidly<br />
  The slow and scanty commerce of the stream.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Eastward, upon another fertile stretch<br />
  Of meadow-sward and tilth, embowered in elms,<br />
  Lay the twin streets, and sprang the single spire<br />
  Of Hadley, where the hunted regicides<br />
  Securely lived of old, and strangely died;<br />
  And eastward still, upon the last green step<br />
  From which the Angel of the Morning Light<br />
  Leaps to the meadow-lands, fair Amherst sat,<br />
  Capped by her many-windowed colleges;<br />
  While from his outpost in the rising North,<br />
  Bald with the storms and ruddy with the suns<br />
  Of the long eons, stood old Sugarloaf,<br />
  Gazing with changeless brow upon a scene,<br />
  Changing to fairer beauty evermore.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Save of the river and my pleasant home,<br />
  I knew not then the names and history<br />
  Borne by these visions; but upon my brain<br />
  Their forms were graved in lines indelible<br />
  As, on the rocks beneath my feet, the prints<br />
  Of life in its first motion.  Later years<br />
  Renewed the picture, and its outlines filled<br />
  With fair associations,&mdash;wrought the past<br />
  And living present into fadeless wreaths<br />
  That crowned each mound and mount, and town and tower,<br />
  The king of teeming memories.  Nor could<br />
  I guess with faintest foresight of the life<br />
  Which, in the years before me, I should weave<br />
  Of mingled threads of pleasure and of pain<br />
  Into these scenes, until not one of all<br />
  Could meet my eye, or touch my memory,<br />
  Without recalling an experience<br />
  That drank the sweetest ichor of my veins<br />
  Or crowded them with joy.<br />

  From the wide survey, and with pleased surprise<br />
  Detected, nestling at the mountain's foot,<br />
  The cottage I had left; and, on the lawn,<br />
  Two forms of life that flitted to and fro.<br />
  I knew that they had missed me; so I sought<br />
  The passage I had climbed, and, with the lamb<br />
  Still fastened to my wrist, I hasted down.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Full of the marvels of the hour I sped,<br />
  Leaping from rock to rock, or flying swift<br />
  The smoother slopes, with arms half wings, and feet<br />
  That only guarded the descent, the while<br />
  My captive led me captive at his will.<br />
  So tense the strain of sinew, so intense<br />
  The mood and motion, that before I guessed,<br />
  The headlong flight was finished, and I walked,<br />
  Jaded and reeking, in the level path<br />
  That led the lambkin home.<br />
</p>

  And ran to meet me: then for long, still hours,<br />
  Couched in a dim, cool room, I lay and slept.<br />
  When I awoke, I found her at my side,<br />
  Fanning my face, and ready with her smile<br />
  And soothing words to greet me.  Then I told,<br />
  With youthful volubility and wild<br />
  Extravagance of figure and of phrase,<br />
  The morning's exploit.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">

  But, as I wrought each scene and circumstance<br />
  Into consistent form, she drank my words<br />
  In eager silence; and within her eyes<br />
  I saw the glow of pride which gravity<br />
  And show of deep concern could not disguise,<br />
  I read her bosom better than she knew.<br />
  I saw that she had made discovery<br />
  Of something unsuspected in her child,<br />
  And that, by one I loved, and she the best,<br />
  The fire that burned within me and the power<br />
  That morning called to life, were recognized.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  When I had told my story, and had read<br />
  With kindling pride my praises in her eyes,<br />
  She placed her soft hand on my brow, and said:<br />
  "My Paul has climbed the noblest mountain height<br />
  In all his little world, and gazed on scenes<br />
  As beautiful as rest beneath the sun.<br />
  I trust he will remember all his life<br />
  That to his best achievement, and the spot<br />
  Nearest to heaven his youthful feet have trod,<br />
  He has been guided by a guileless lamb.<br />
  It is an omen which his mother's heart<br />
  Will treasure with her jewels."<br />

  Of the long summer day hung but an hour<br />
  Above his setting, and the cool West Wind<br />
  Bore from the purpling hills his benison,<br />
  The farewell courtesies of love were given,<br />
  And we set forth for home.<br />

  The river left behind&mdash;when, looking back,<br />
  I saw the mountain in the searching light<br />
  Of the low sun.  Surcharged with youthful pride<br />
  In my adventure, I can ne'er forget<br />
  The disappointment and chagrin which fell<br />
  Upon me; for a change had passed.  The steep<br />
  Which in the morning sprang to kiss the sun,<br />
  Had left the scene; and in its place I saw<br />
  A shrunken pile, whose paths my steps had climbed.<br />
  Whose proudest height my humble feet had trod.<br />
  Its grand impossibilities and all<br />
  Its store of marvels and of mysteries<br />
  Were flown away, and would not be recalled.<br />
  The mountain's might had entered into me;<br />
  And, from that fruitful hour, whatever scene<br />
  Nature revealed to me, she never caught<br />
  My spirit humbled by surprise.  My thought<br />
  Built higher mountains than I ever found;<br />
  Poured wilder cataracts than I ever saw;<br />
  Drove grander storms than ever swept the sky;<br />
  Pushed into loftier heavens and lower hells<br />
  Than the abysmal reach of light and dark;<br />
  And entertained me with diviner feasts<br />
  Than ever met the appetite of sense,<br />
  And poured me wine of choicer vintages<br />
  Than fire the hearts of kings.<br />

  Which in the morning kindled in my veins<br />
  Had died away; and at my mother's side<br />
  I walked in quiet mood, and gravely spoke<br />
  Of the great future.  With a tender quest<br />
  My mother probed my secret wish, and heard,<br />
  With silence new and strange respectfulness,<br />
  The revelation of my plans.  I felt<br />
  In her benign attention to my words;<br />
  In her suggestions, clothed with gracious phrase<br />
  To win my judgment; and in all those shades<br />
  Of mien and manner which a mother's love<br />
  Inspires so quickly when the form it nursed<br />
  Becomes a staff in its caressing hand,<br />
  She had made space for me, and placed her life<br />
  In new relations to my own.  I knew<br />
  That she who through my span of tender years<br />
  Had counselled me, had given me privilege<br />
  Within her councils; and the moment came<br />
  I learned that in the converse of that hour,<br />
  The appetency of maternity<br />
  For manhood in its offspring, had laid hold<br />
  Of the fresh growth in me, and feasted well<br />
  Its gentle passion.<br />

  The plans for study were matured, and I,<br />
  Who, with an aptitude beyond my years,<br />
  Had gathered learning's humbler rudiments<br />
  From her to whom I owed my earliest words,<br />

  Were won too easily to bring me pride,<br />

  So feebly and so clumsily.  When won,<br />

  From month to month, from year to year, I saw<br />

  Dependent, trustful and subordinate&mdash;<br />
  Deferred to me in all things, and in all<br />
  Gave me the parent's place and took the child's.<br />
  She waited for my coming like a child;<br />
  She ran to meet and greet me like a child;<br />
  She leaned on me for guidance and defence,<br />
  And lived in me, and by me, like a child.<br />
  If I were absent long beyond my wont,<br />
  She yielded to distresses and to tears;<br />
  And when I came, she flew into my arms<br />
  With childish impulse of delight, or chid<br />
  With weak complainings my delay.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By these,<br />
  And by a thousand other childish ways,<br />
  I knew disease was busy with her life,<br />
  Working distempers in her heart and brain,<br />
  And driving her for succor to my strength.<br />
  The change was great in her, though slowly wrought,&mdash;<br />
  Though wrought so slowly that my thought and life<br />
  Had been adjusted to it, but for this:&mdash;<br />
  One dismal night, a trivial accident<br />
  Had kept me from my home beyond the hour<br />
  At which my promise stood for my return.<br />
  Arriving at the garden gate, I paused<br />
  To catch a glimpse of the accustomed light,<br />
  Through the cold mist that wrapped me, but in vain.<br />
  Only one window glimmered through the gloom,<br />
  Through whose uncurtained panes I dimly saw<br />
  My mother in her chamber.  She was clad<br />
  In the white robe of rest; but to and fro<br />
  She crossed the light, sometimes with hands pressed close<br />
  Upon her brow, sometimes raised up toward heaven,<br />
  As if in deprecation or despair;<br />
  And through the strident soughing of the elm<br />
  I heard her voice, still musical in woe,<br />
  Wailing and calling.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a noiseless step<br />
  I reached the door, and, with a noiseless key,<br />
  Turned back the bolt, and stood within.  I could<br />
  Have called her to my arms, and quelled her fears<br />
  By one dear word, and yet, I spoke it not.<br />
  I longed to learn her secret, and to know<br />
  In what recess of history or heart<br />
  It hid, and wrought her awful malady.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Not long I waited, when I heard her voice<br />
  Wail out again in wild, beseeching prayer,&mdash;<br />
  Her voice so sweet and soulful, that it seemed<br />
  As if a listening fiend could not refuse<br />
  Such help as in him lay, although her tongue<br />
  Should falter to articulate her pain.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I heard her voice&mdash;O God!  I heard her words!<br />
  Not bolts of burning from the vengeful sky<br />
  Had scathed or stunned me more.  I shook like one<br />
  Powerless within the toils of some great sin,<br />
  Or some o'ermastering passion; or like one<br />
  Whose veins turn ice at onset of the plague.<br />
  "O God," she said, "my Father and my Friend!<br />
  Spare him to me, and save me from myself!<br />
  O! if thou help me not&mdash;if thou forsake&mdash;<br />
  This hand which thou hast made, will take the life<br />
  Thou mad'st the hand to feed.  I cling to him,<br />
  My son,&mdash;my boy.  If danger come to him,<br />
  No one is left to save me from this crime.<br />
  Thou knowest, O! my God, how I have striven<br />
  To quench the awful impulse; how, in vain,<br />
  My prayers have gone before thee, for release<br />
  From the foul demon who would drive my soul<br />
  To crime that leaves no space for penitence.<br />
  O!  Father!  Father!  Hear me when I call!<br />
  Hast thou not made me?  Am I not thy child?<br />
  Why, why this mad, mysterious desire<br />
  To follow him I loved, by the dark door<br />
  Through which he forced his passage to the realm<br />
  That death throws wide to all?  O why must I,<br />
  A poor, weak woman&mdash;"<br />

  But dropped my dripping cloak, and, with a voice,<br />
  Toned to its tenderest cadence, I pronounced<br />
  The sweet word, "mother!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her excess of joy<br />
  Burst in a cry, and in a moment's space<br />
  I sat within her room, and she, my child,<br />
  Was sobbing in my arms.  I spoke no word,<br />
  But sat distracted with my tenderness<br />
  For her who threw herself upon my heart<br />
  In perfect trust, and bitter thoughts of Him<br />
  Whose succor, though importunately sought<br />
  In piteous pleadings by a gentle saint,<br />
  Was grudgingly withheld.  Her closing words:<br />
  "O why must I, a poor, weak woman&mdash;" rang<br />
  Through every chamber of my tortured soul,<br />
  And called to conclave and rebellion all<br />
  The black-browed passions thitherto restrained.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ay, why should she, who only sought for God,<br />
  Be given to a devil?  Why should she<br />
  Who begged for bread be answered with a stone?<br />
  Ay, why should she whose soul recoiled from sin<br />
  As from a fiend, find in her heart a fiend<br />
  To urge the sin she hated?&mdash;questions all<br />
  The fiends within me answered as they would.<br />
  O God!  O Father!  How I hated thee!<br />
  Nay, how within my angry soul I dared<br />
  To curse thy sacred name!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">

  Thoughts of myself and of my destiny&mdash;<br />
  Succeeded.  Who and what was I?  A youth,<br />
  Doomed by hereditary taint to crime,<br />
  A youth whose every artery and vein<br />
  Was doubly charged with suicidal blood.<br />
  When the full consciousness of what I was<br />
  Possessed my thought, and I gazed down the abyss<br />
  God had prepared for me, I shrank aghast;<br />
  And there in silence, with an awful oath<br />
  I dare not write, I swore my will was mine,<br />
  And mine my hand; and that, though all the fiends<br />
  That cumber hell and overrun the earth<br />
  Should spur the deadly impulse of my blood,<br />
  And heaven withhold the aid I would not ask;<br />
  Though woes unnumbered should beset my life,<br />
  And reason fall, and uttermost despair<br />
  Hold me a hopeless prisoner in its glooms,<br />
  I would resist and conquer, and live out<br />
  My complement of years.  My bosom burned<br />
  With fierce defiance, and the angry blood<br />
  Leaped from my heart, and boomed within my brain<br />
  With throbs that stunned me, though each fiery thrill<br />
  Was charged with tenderness for her whose head<br />
  Was pillowed on its riot.<br />

  How long, I know not&mdash;but at last the sad,<br />
  Hysteric sobs and suspirations ceased,<br />
  Or only at wide intervals recurred;<br />
  And then I rose, and to her waiting bed<br />
  Led my doomed mother.  With a cheerful voice&mdash;<br />
  Cheerful as I could summon&mdash;and a kiss,<br />
  I bade her a good night and pleasant dreams;<br />
  And then, across the hall, I sought my room<br />
  Where neither sleep nor dream awaited me,<br />
  But only blasphemous, black thoughts, and strife<br />
  With God and Destiny.<br />
</p>

  The lamp that from my mother's window beamed,<br />
  Illumined other nights and other storms,<br />
  And by its lurid light revealed to me<br />
  The secrets of a life.  Her sudden pangs,<br />
  Her brooding woes, her terrors when alone,<br />
  The strange surrender of her will to mine,<br />
  Her hunger for my presence, and her fear<br />
  That by some slip of fortune she should lose<br />
  Her hold on me, were followed to their home&mdash;<br />
  To her poor heart, that fluttered every hour<br />
  With conscious presence of an enemy<br />
  That would not be expelled, and strove to spill<br />
  The life it spoiled.<br />

  She was not left alone.  I called a friend,<br />
  A cheerful lady, whose companionship<br />
  Was music, medicine and rest; and she,<br />
  Wanting a home, and with a ready wit<br />
  Learning my mother's need and my desire,<br />
  Assumed the place of matron in the house;<br />
  And, in return for what we gave to her,<br />
  Gave us herself.<br />

  By her self-confidence, she quickly won;<br />
  And thus, though sadly burdened at my heart,<br />
  I found one burden lifted from my hands.<br />
  More liberty of movement and of toil<br />
  I needed; for the time was drawing near<br />
  When I should turn my feet toward other halls,<br />
  To seek maturer study, and complete<br />
  The work of culture faithfully begun.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Into my mother's ear I breathed my plans<br />
  With careful words.  The university<br />
  Was but a short remove&mdash;a morning's walk&mdash;<br />
  Away from her; and ever at her wish&mdash;<br />
  Nay, always when I could&mdash;I would return;<br />
  And separation would but sweeten love,<br />
  And joy of meeting recompense the pain<br />
  Of parting and of absence.<br />

  And leaning in her thought upon her friend.<br />
  Gave her consent.  So, on a summer day,<br />
  I kissed her faded cheek, and turned from home<br />
  To seek the college halls that I had seen<br />
  From boyhood's mount of vision.<br />

  Passed there in study&mdash;of the rivalries,<br />
  The long, stern struggles for pre-eminence,<br />
  The triumphs hardly won, but won at last<br />
  Beyond all cavil, matters not to tell.<br />
  It was my grief that while I gained and grew,<br />
  My mother languished momently, and lost,&mdash;<br />
  A grief that turned to poison in my blood.<br />
  The college prayers were mummeries to me,<br />
  And with disdainful passion I repelled<br />
  All Christian questionings of heart and life,<br />
  By old and young.<br />
</p>

  I sought no favors, took no courtesies<br />
  With grateful grace, and nursed my haughty pride.<br />
  The men who kneeled and gloomed, and prayed and sang,<br />
  Seemed but a brood of dullards, whom contempt<br />
  Would honor overmuch.  No tender spot<br />
  Was left within my indurated heart,<br />
  Save that which moved with ever-melting ruth<br />
  For her whose breast had nursed me, and whose love<br />
  Had given my life the only happiness<br />
  It yet had known.<br />

  With more than faithful punctuality.<br />
  Few weeks passed by in all those busy years<br />
  In which I did not walk the way between<br />
  The college and my home, and bear to her<br />
  Such consolation as my presence gave.<br />
  In truth, my form was as familiar grown<br />
  To all the rustic dwellers on the road<br />
  As I had been a post-boy.<br />

  These visits won for me&mdash;little beyond<br />
  That which I found in bearing joy to her&mdash;<br />
  For every year marked on her slender frames<br />
  And on her cheeks, and on her failing brain,<br />
  Its record of decadence.  I could see<br />
  That she was sinking into helplessness,<br />
  And that too soon her inoffensive soul,<br />
  With all its sweet affections, would go down<br />
  To hopeless wreck and darkness.<br />

  I learned that still the burden of her prayer<br />
  Was, that she might be saved from one great sin&mdash;<br />
  The sin of self-destruction.  Every hour<br />
  This one petition struggled from her heart,<br />
  To reach the ear of heaven; yet never help<br />
  Came down in answer to her cry.<br />

  That ushered in my closing college-year<br />
  Came up the valley on her balmy wings,<br />
  And Winter fled away, and left no trace,<br />
  Save, here and there a snowy drift, to show<br />
  Where his cold feet had rested in their flight.<br />
  But one still night, within the span of sleep,<br />
  A shivering winter cloud that wandered late<br />
  Shook to the frosty ground its inch of rime.<br />
  So, when the morning rose, the earth was white;<br />
  And shrubs and trees, and roofs and rocks and walls,<br />
  Fulgent with downy crystals, made a world<br />
  To which a breath were ruin; and a breath<br />
  Wrecked it for me, and, by a few sad words,<br />
  Blotted the sunlit splendor from my sight.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  As I looked out upon the scene, and mused<br />
  Of her to whom I hoped it might impart<br />
  Some healthy touch of joy, I heard the beat<br />
  Of hoofs upon the trackless blank, and saw<br />
  A horseman speeding up the avenue.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I raised my sash (I knew he came for me),<br />
  And faltered forth my question.  From his breast<br />
  He drew a folded slip: dismounting then,<br />
  He stooped and pressed the missive in a mass<br />
  Of clinging snow, and tossed it to my hand.<br />
  I closed the window, burst the frosty seal,<br />
  And read: "Your mother cannot long survive:<br />
  Come home to her to-day."  I did not pause<br />
  To break the fast of night, but rushing forth,<br />
  I followed close the messenger's return.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It was a morning, such as comes but once<br />
  In all the Spring,&mdash;so still and beautiful,<br />
  So full of promise, so exhilarant<br />
  With frost and fire, in earth and air, that life<br />
  Had been a brimming joy but for the scene<br />
  That waited for my eyes&mdash;the scene of death&mdash;<br />
  From which imagination staggered back,<br />
  And every sensibility recoiled.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The smoke from distant sugar-camps rolled up<br />
  Through the still ether in columnar coils&mdash;<br />
  Blue pillars of a bluer dome&mdash;and all<br />
  The resonant air was full of sounds of Spring.<br />
  The sheep were bleating round their empty ricks;<br />
  Horses let loose were calling from afar,<br />
  And winning fierce replies; the axeman's blows<br />
  Fell nimbly at the piles which wintry woods<br />
  Had lent to summer stores; while far and faint,<br />
  The rhythmic ululations of the hound<br />
  On a fresh trail, upon the mountain's side,<br />
  Added their strange wild music to the morn.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The beauty and the music caught my sense,<br />
  But woke within my sick and sinking heart<br />
  No motion of response.  I walked as one<br />
  Condemned to dungeon-glooms might walk<br />
  Through shouts of mirth and festal pageantry,<br />
  Hearing and seeing all, yet over all<br />
  Hearing the clank of chains and clash of bars,<br />
  And seeing but the reptiles of his cell.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  How I arrived at home, without fatigue,<br />
  Without a thought of effort&mdash;onward borne<br />
  By one absorbing and impelling thought&mdash;<br />
  As one within a minute's mete may slide,<br />
  O'er leagues of sunny dreamland in a dream,<br />
  By magic or by miracle&mdash;I found<br />
  No time to question.<br />

  I stood and listened: soon I heard my name<br />
  Pronounced within in spiteful whisperings.<br />
  I raised the latch, and met her burning eyes.<br />
  She stared a wild, mad stare, then raised herself,<br />
  And in weak fury poured upon my head<br />
  The vials of her wrath.  I stood like stone,<br />
  Without the power to speak, the while she rained<br />
  Her maledictions on me, and in words<br />
  Fit only for the damned, accused my life<br />
  Of crimes my language could not name, and deeds<br />
  Which only outcast wretches know.<br />

  I gained my tongue, and tried to take her hand;<br />
  But with a shriek which cut me like a knife<br />
  She shrank from me, and hid her quivering face<br />
  Within her pillow.<br />

  And sought the room where oft in better days<br />
  We both had knelt together at my bed,<br />
  And, making fast my door, I threw myself<br />
  Prone on the precious couch, and gave to grief<br />
  My strong and stormy nature.  All the day<br />
  With bursts of passion I bewailed my loss,<br />
  Or lay benumbed in feeling and in thought,<br />
  Tasting no food, and shutting out my soul<br />
  From all approach of human sympathy,<br />
  Till the light waned, and through the leafless boughs<br />
  Of the old elm I caught the sheen of stars.<br />
  Then sleep descended&mdash;such a sleep as comes<br />
  To uttermost exhaustion,&mdash;sleep with dreams<br />
  Wild as the waking fantasies of her<br />
  Whose screams and incoherent words gave voice<br />
  To all their phantom brood.<br />

  The house was still as death; and yet I heard,<br />
  Or thought I heard, the touch of crafty feet<br />
  Upon the carpet, creeping by my door.<br />
  It passed away, away; and then a pause,<br />
  Still and presageful as the breathless calm<br />
  On which the storm-cloud mounts the pallid West,<br />
  Succeeded.  I could hear the parlor-clock<br />
  Counting the beaded silence, and my bed,<br />
  Rustling beneath my breathing and my pulse,<br />
  Was sharply crepitant, and gave me pain.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  An hour passed by (it loitered like an age),<br />
  And then came hurried words and hasty fall<br />
  Of footsteps in the passage.  I could hear<br />
  Screams, sobs, and whispered calls and closing doors<br />
  And heavy feet that jarred my bed, and shook<br />
  The windows of my room.  I did not stir:<br />
  I dared not stir, but lay in deathly dread,<br />
  Waiting the sad denouement.  Soon it came.<br />
  A man approached my door, and tried the latch;<br />
  Then knocked, and called.  I knew the kindly voice<br />
  Of the physician, and threw back the bolt.<br />
  Then by the light he held before his face<br />
  I read the fact of death.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took his arm,<br />
  And, as I feebly staggered down the stairs,<br />
  He broke to me with lack of useless words<br />
  The awful truth....  The old familiar tale:<br />
  She counterfeited sleep: the nurses both,<br />
  Weary with over-watching in their chairs,<br />
  Under the cumbrous stillness, slept indeed;<br />
  And when she knew it, she escaped; and then<br />
  She did the deed to which for many years<br />
  She had been predisposed.  Perhaps I knew<br />
  The nature of the case: perhaps I knew<br />
  My father went that way.  I clutched his arm:<br />
  There was no need of words.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parlor door<br />
  Stood open, and a throng of silent friends,<br />
  Choking with tears, gazed on a silent form<br />
  Shrouded in snowy linen.  They made way<br />
  For me and my companion.  On my knees<br />
  I clasped the precious clay, and pouring forth<br />
  My pitying love and tenderness for her,<br />
  I gave indignant voice to my complaint<br />
  Against the Being who, to all her prayers<br />
  For succor and security, had turned<br />
  A deaf, dead ear and a repelling hand.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  To what blaspheming utterance I gave<br />
  My raving passion, may the God I cursed<br />
  Forbid my shrinking memory to recall!<br />
  I now remember only that when drawn<br />
  By strong, determined hands away from her,<br />
  The room was vacant.  Every pitying friend<br />
  Had flown my presence and the room, to find<br />
  Release of sensibility from words<br />
  That roused their superstitious souls to fear<br />
  That God would smite me through the blinding smoke<br />
  Of my great torment.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence, for the rest!<br />
  It was a dream; and only as a dream<br />
  Do I remember it: the coffined form,<br />
  The funeral&mdash;a concourse of the town&mdash;<br />
  The trembling prayer for me, the choking sobs,<br />
  The long procession, the descending clods,<br />
  The slow return, articulated all<br />
  With wild, mad words of mine, and gentle speech<br />
  Of those who sought to curb or comfort me&mdash;<br />
  All was a dream, from which I woke at length<br />
  With heart as dead as hers who slept.  The heavens<br />
  Were brass above me, and the breathing world<br />
  Was void and meaningless.  When told to pray,<br />
  This was the logic of my heart's reply:<br />
  If God be Love, not such is He to me<br />
  Nor such to mine.  If He heard not the voice<br />
  Of such a lovely saint as she I mourned,<br />
  Mine would but rouse His vengeance.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I closed<br />
  With Reason's hand the adamantine doors<br />
  Which only Faith unlocks, and shut my soul<br />
  Away from God, the warder of a gang<br />
  Of passions that in darkness stormed or gloomed<br />
  And with each other fought, or on themselves<br />
  Gnawed for the nourishment which I denied.<br />

  COMPLAINT.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  River, sparkling river, I have fault to find with thee<br />
  River, thou dost never give a word of peace to me!<br />
  Dimpling to each touch of sunshine, wimpling to each air that blows,<br />
  Thou dost make no sweet replying to my sighing for repose.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Flowers of mount and meadow, I have fault to find with you;<br />
  So the breezes cross and toss you, so your cups are filled with dew,<br />
  Matters not though sighs give motion to the ocean of your breath;<br />
  Matters not though you are filling with the chilling drops of death!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Birds of song and beauty, lo!  I charge you all with blame:&mdash;<br />
  Though all hapless passions thrill and fill me, you are still the same.<br />
  I can borrow for my sorrow nothing that avails<br />
  From your lonely note, that only speaks of joy that never fails.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O! indifference of Nature to the fact of human pain!<br />
  Every grief that seeks relief entreats it at her hand in vain;<br />
  Not a bird speaks forth its passion, not a river seeks the sea,<br />
  Nor a flower from wreaths of Summer breathes in sympathy with me.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O! the rigid rock is frigid, though its bed be summer mould,<br />
  And the diamond glitters ever in the grasp of changeless gold;<br />
  And the laws that bring the seasons swing their cycles as they must,<br />
  Though the ample road they trample blind the eyes with human dust.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Moons will wax in argent glory, though man wane to hopeless gloom;<br />
  Stars will sparkle in their splendor, though he darkle to his doom;<br />
  Winds of heaven he calls to fan him ban him with an icy chill,<br />
  And the shifting crowds of clouds go drifting o'er him as they will.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Yet within my inmost spirit I can hear an undertone,<br />
  That by law of prime relation holds these voices as its own,&mdash;<br />
  The full tonic whose harmonic grandeurs rise through Nature's words,<br />
  From the ocean's thundrous rolling to the trolling of the birds.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Spirit, O! my spirit!  Is it thou art out of tune?<br />
  Art thou clinging to December while the earth is in its June?<br />
  Hast thou dropped thy part in nature?  Hast thou touched another key?<br />
  Art thou angry that the anthem will not, cannot, wait for thee?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Spirit, thou art left alone&mdash;alone on waters wild;<br />
  For God is gone, and Love is dead, and Nature spurns her child.<br />
  Thou art drifting in a deluge, waves below and clouds above,<br />
  And with weary wings come back to thee, thy raven and thy dove.<br />

<h2>
  PART II.

<h3>
  LOVE.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  As from a deep, dead sea, by drastic lift<br />
  Of pent volcanic fires, the dripping form<br />
  Of a new island swells to meet the air,<br />
  And, after months of idle basking, feels<br />
  The prickly feet of life from countless germs<br />
  Creeping along its sides, and reaching up<br />
  In fern and flower to the life-giving sun,<br />
  So from my grief I rose, and so at length<br />
  I felt new life returning: so I felt<br />
  The life already wakened stretching forth<br />
  To stronger light and purer atmosphere.<br />
  But most I longed for human love&mdash;the source<br />
  (So sadly closed), from which my life had drawn<br />
  Its sweetest inspiration and reward.<br />
  I could not pray, nor could my spirit win<br />
  From sights and sounds of nature the response<br />
  It vaguely yearned for.  They assailed my sense<br />
  With senseless seeming of the hum and whirl<br />
  Of vast machinery, whose motive power<br />
  Sought its own ends, or wrought for ministry<br />
  To other life than mine.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could stand still,<br />
  And see the trains sweep by; could hear the roar<br />
  Of thundering wheels; could watch the pearly plumes<br />
  That floated where they flew; could catch a glimpse<br />
  Of thousand happy faces at the glass;<br />
  But felt that all their freighted life and wealth<br />
  Were nought to me, and moved toward other souls<br />
  In other latitudes.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year had flown,<br />
  And more, when, on a Sunday morn in June,<br />
  I wandered out, to wear away the hours<br />
  Of growing restlessness.  The worshippers<br />
  Were thronging to the service of the day,<br />
  And gave me sidelong stare, or shunned me quite;<br />
  As if they knew me for a reprobate,<br />
  And feared a taint of death.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took the road<br />
  That eastward cleft the town, and sought the bridge<br />
  That spanned the river, reaching which I crossed.<br />
  Then deep within the stripes of springing corn<br />
  I found the shadow of an elm, and lay<br />
  Stretched on the downy grass for listless hours,<br />
  Dreaming of days gone by, or turning o'er<br />
  With careless hand the pages of a book<br />
  I had brought with me.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tired at length I rose,<br />
  And, touched by some light impulse, moved along<br />
  The old, familiar road.  I loitered on<br />
  In a blind reverie, nor marked the while<br />
  The furlongs or the time, until the spell<br />
  In a full burst of music was dissolved.<br />
  I startled as one startles from a dream,<br />
  And saw the church of Hadley, from whose doors,<br />
  Open to summer air, the choral hymn<br />
  Poured out its measured tides, and rose and fell<br />
  Upon the silence in broad cadences,<br />
  As from a far, careering sea, the waves<br />
  Lift into silver swells the sleeping breasts<br />
  Of land-locked bays.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I heard the sound of flutes<br />
  And hoarse, sonorous viols, in accord<br />
  With happy human voices,&mdash;and one voice&mdash;<br />
  A woman's or an angel's&mdash;that compelled<br />
  My feet to swift approach.  A thread of gold,<br />
  Through all the web of sound, I followed it<br />
  Till, by the stress of some strange sympathy,<br />
  And by no act of will, I joined my voice<br />
  To that one voice of melody, and sang.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The heart is wiser than the intellect,<br />
  And works with swifter hands and surer feet<br />
  Toward wise conclusions.  So, without resort<br />
  To reason, in my heart I knew that she<br />
  Who sang had suffered&mdash;knew that she had grieved,<br />
  Had hungered, struggled, kissed the cheek of death,<br />
  And ranged the scale of passions till her soul<br />
  Was deep, and wide, and soft with sympathy;&mdash;<br />
  Nay, more than this: that she had found at last<br />
  Peace like a river, on whose waveless tide<br />
  She floated while she sang.  This was the key<br />
  That loosed my prisoned voice, and filled my eyes<br />
  With tender tears, and touched to life again<br />
  My better nature.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the choral closed,<br />
  And the last chord in silence lapsed away,<br />
  I raised my eyes, and, nodding to the beck<br />
  Of the old, slippered sexton, I went in,&mdash;<br />
  Not (shall it be confessed?) to find the God<br />
  At whose plain altar bowed the rural throng;<br />
  But, through a voice, to follow to its source<br />
  The influence that moved me.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was late;<br />
  And many eyes looked up as I advanced<br />
  Through the broad aisle, and took a seat that turned<br />
  My face to all the faces in the house.<br />
  I scanned the simpering girls within the choir,<br />
  But found not what I sought; and then my eyes<br />
  With rambling inquisition swept the pews,<br />
  Pausing at every maiden face in vain.<br />
  One head, that crowned a tall and slender form,<br />
  Was bowed with reverent grace upon the rail<br />
  Before her; and, although I caught no glimpse<br />
  Of her sweet face, I knew such face was there,<br />
  And there the voice.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Communion Day.<br />
  The simple table underneath the desk<br />
  Was draped with linen, on whose snow was spread<br />
  The feast of love&mdash;the vases filled with wine,<br />
  The separated bread and circling cups.<br />
  The venerable pastor had come down<br />
  From his high pulpit, and assumed the seat<br />
  Of presidence, and, with benignant eyes,<br />
  Sat smiling on his flock.  The deacons all<br />
  Rose from their pews&mdash;four old, brown-handed men<br />
  With frosty hair&mdash;and took the ancient chairs<br />
  That flanked the table.  All the house was still<br />
  Save here and there the rustle of a silk<br />
  Or folding of a fan; and over all<br />
  Brooded the dove of peace.  I had no part<br />
  In the fair spectacle, but I could feel<br />
  That it was beautiful and sweet as heaven.<br />
  When the old pastor rose, with solemn mien,<br />
  I looked to see the lady lift her head;<br />
  But still she bowed; and then I heard these words;<br />
  "The person who unites with us to-day<br />
  Will take her place before me in the aisle,<br />
  To give her answer to our creed, and speak<br />
  The pledges of our covenant."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then first<br />
  I saw her face.  With modest grace she rose,<br />
  Lifted her hat, and gave it to the hand<br />
  Of a companion, and within the aisle<br />
  Stood out alone.  My heart beat thick and fast<br />
  With vision of her perfect loveliness,<br />
  And apprehension of the heroism<br />
  That shone within her eyes, and made her act<br />
  A Christ-like sacrifice.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O! eyes of blue!<br />
  O! lily throat and cheeks of faintest rose!<br />
  O! brow serene, enthroned in holy thought!<br />
  O! soft, brown sweeps of hair!  O! shapely grace<br />
  Of maidenhood, enrobed in virgin white!<br />
  Why, in your rapt unconsciousness of me<br />
  And all around you&mdash;in the presence-hall<br />
  Of God and angels&mdash;at the marriage-feast<br />
  Of Jesus and his chosen&mdash;did my eyes<br />
  Profane the hour with other feast than yours?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I heard the "You Believe" of the old creed<br />
  Of puritan New England; and I heard<br />
  The old "You Promise" of its covenant.<br />
  Her bow of reverent assent to all<br />
  The knotty dogmas, and her silent pledge<br />
  Of faithfulness and fellowship, I saw.<br />
  These formularies were the frame of oak&mdash;<br />
  Gnarled, strongly carved, and swart with age and use&mdash;<br />
  Which held the lovely picture of my saint,<br />
  And showed her saintliness and beauty well.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  At close of the recital and response,<br />
  The pastor raised the plain, baptismal bowl,<br />
  And she, the maiden devotee, advanced<br />
  And knelt before him.  Lifting then her eyes<br />
  To him and heaven, with look of earnest faith<br />
  And perfect consecration, she received<br />
  Upon her brow the water from his hand.<br />
  The trickling chrism shone on her cheeks like tears,<br />
  The while he joined her lovely name with God's:<br />
  "KATHRINA, I BAPTIZE THEE IN THE NAME<br />
  OF FATHER, SON, AND HOLY GHOST, AMEN!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Still kneeling like a saint before a shrine,<br />
  She closed her eyes.  Then lifting up toward heaven<br />
  His hands, the pastor prayed,&mdash;prayed that her soul<br />
  Might be forever kept from stain and sin;<br />
  That Christ might live in her, and through her life<br />
  Shine into other souls; might give her strength<br />
  To master all temptation, and to keep<br />
  The vows that day assumed; might comfort her<br />
  In every sorrow, and, in death's dread hour,<br />
  Bear her in hopeful triumph to the rest<br />
  Prepared for those who love him.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this scene<br />
  I saw through blinding tears.  The poetry<br />
  That like a soft aureola embraced<br />
  Within its cope those two contrasted forms;<br />
  The eager observation and the hush<br />
  That reigned through all the house; the breathless spell<br />
  Of sweet solemnity and tender awe<br />
  Which held all hearts, when she, The Beautiful,<br />
  Received the sign of marriage to The Good,<br />
  O'erwhelmed me, and I wept.  Shall I confess<br />
  That in the struggle to repress my tears<br />
  And hold my swelling heart, I grudged her gift,<br />
  And felt that, by the measure she had risen,<br />
  She had put space between herself and me,<br />
  And quenched my hope?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood while courtesy<br />
  Of formal Christian welcome was bestowed;<br />
  Then straightway sought her seat, as though no eyes<br />
  But those of One unseen observed her steps.<br />
  I saw her taste the sacramental bread,<br />
  And touch the silver chalice to her lips;<br />
  And while she thought of Him, The Spotless One<br />
  Whose flesh and blood were symboled to her heart,<br />
  And worshipped in her thought, I ate and drank<br />
  Her virgin beauty&mdash;with what guilty sense<br />
  Of profanation!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, the closing hymn<br />
  Gave me her voice again; and this I drank;<br />
  Nay, this invaded and pervaded me.<br />
  Its subtile search found out the sleeping chords<br />
  Of sympathy; and on the bridge of sound<br />
  It built between our souls, I crossed, and saw<br />
  Into the depths of purity and love&mdash;<br />
  The full, pathetic power of womanhood&mdash;<br />
  From which the structure sprang.  Just once<br />
  I caught her eyes.  She blushed with consciousness<br />
  Of my strong gaze; but paused not in her hymn<br />
  Till she had given to every word the wings<br />
  That bore it, like a singing bird, toward heaven.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The benediction fell; and then the throng<br />
  Passed slowly out.  I was the last to go.<br />
  I saw a man whom I had known, and shrank<br />
  Both from his greetings and his questionings.<br />
  One thing I learned: that she who thus had joined<br />
  This cluster of disciples was not born<br />
  And reared among their number: that was plain.<br />
  I saw it in her bearing and her dress;<br />
  In that unconsciousness of self that comes<br />
  Of gentle breeding, and society<br />
  Of gentle men and women; in the ease<br />
  With which she bore the awkward deference<br />
  Of those who spoke with her adown the aisle;<br />
  In distant and admiring gaze of men,<br />
  And the cold scrutiny of village girls<br />
  Who passed for belles.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood upon the steps&mdash;<br />
  The last who left the door&mdash;and there I found<br />
  The lady and her friend.  The elder turned,<br />
  And with a cordial greeting took my hand,<br />
  And rallied me on my forgetfulness.<br />
  Her eyes, her smile, her manner and her voice<br />
  Touched the quick springs of memory, and I spoke<br />
  Her name.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was my mother's early friend,<br />
  Whose face I had not seen in all the years<br />
  That had flown over us, since, from her door,<br />
  I chased her lamb to where I found&mdash;myself.<br />
  She spoke with tender words and swimming eyes<br />
  Of her I mourned, and questioned me like one<br />
  Who felt a mother's anxious interest<br />
  In all my cares and plans.  Why did I not<br />
  In all my maunderings and wanderings<br />
  Remember I had friends, and visit them&mdash;<br />
  Not missing her?  Her niece was with her now;<br />
  Would live with her, perhaps&mdash;("a lovely girl!"&mdash;<br />
  In whisper); and they both would so much like<br />
  To see me at their house! (whisper again:<br />
  "Poor child!  I fear it is but dull for her,<br />
  Here in the country.")  Then with sudden thought&mdash;<br />
  "Kathrina!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a blushing smile she turned<br />
  (She had heard every word), and then her aunt&mdash;<br />
  Her voluble, dear aunt&mdash;presented me<br />
  As an old friend&mdash;the son of an old friend&mdash;<br />
  Whose eyes had promised he would visit them,<br />
  Although, in her monopoly of speech,<br />
  She had quite shut him from the chance to say<br />
  So much as that.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I caught the period<br />
  Quick as it dropped, and spoke the happiness<br />
  I had in meeting them, and gave the pledge&mdash;<br />
  No costly thing to give&mdash;to end my walks<br />
  On pleasant nightfalls at the little house<br />
  Under the mountain.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had spoken more,<br />
  But then the carriage, with its single horse,<br />
  For which they waited, rattled to the steps,<br />
  And we descended.  To their lofty seats<br />
  I helped the pair, and in my own I held<br />
  For one sweet moment, hand of all the hands<br />
  In the wide world I longed to clasp the most.<br />
  A courteous "Good Evening, Sir," was all I won<br />
  From its possessor; but her lively aunt<br />
  With playful menace shook her fan at me,<br />
  And said: "Remember, Paul!" and rode away.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "A worldly woman, Sir!" growled a grum throat,<br />
  I turned, and saw the sexton.  Query: "which?"<br />
  "I mean the aunt." ... "And what about the niece?"<br />
  "Too fine for common people!" (with a shrug).<br />
  "I think she is," I said, with quiet voice,<br />
  And turned my feet toward home.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pious girl!<br />
  And what could I be to a pious girl?<br />
  What could she be to me?  Weak questions, these:<br />
  And vain perhaps; but such as young men ask<br />
  On slighter spur than mine.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had bestowed<br />
  Her love, her life, her goodly self on heaven,<br />
  And had been nobly earnest in her gift.<br />
  Before all lovers she had chosen Christ;<br />
  Before all idols, God; before all wish<br />
  And will of loving man, her heart and hand<br />
  Were pledged to duty.  Could she be a wife?<br />
  Could she be mine, with such unstinted wealth<br />
  Of love, and love's devotion, as I craved?<br />
  Would she not leave me for a Sunday School<br />
  Before the first moon's wane?  Would she not seek<br />
  The cant and snuffle of conventicles<br />
  "At early candle-light," and sing her hymns<br />
  To drivelling boors, and cheat me of her songs?<br />
  Would she exhaust herself in "doing good"<br />
  After the modern styles&mdash;in patching quilts,<br />
  And knitting socks, and bearing feeble tracts<br />
  To dirty little children&mdash;not to speak<br />
  Of larger work for missionary folk?<br />
  Would there not come a time (O! fateful time!)<br />
  When Dorcas and her host would fill my house,<br />
  And I by courtesy be held at home<br />
  To entertain their twaddle, and to smile,<br />
  While in God's name and lovely Charity's<br />
  They would consume my substance?  Would she not<br />
  Become the stern and stately president<br />
  Of some society, or figure in the list<br />
  Of slim directresses in spectacles?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So much for questions: then reflections came.<br />
  These pious women make more careful wives<br />
  Than giddy ones.  They do not run away,<br />
  Though, doubtless, husbands live whose hearts would heal,<br />
  Broken by such a blow!  The time they give<br />
  To worship and to pious offices<br />
  Defrauds the mirror mainly; and the gold<br />
  That goes for charity goes not for gems.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Besides, these pious and believing wives<br />
  Make gentle mothers, who, with self-control<br />
  And patient firmness, train their children well&mdash;<br />
  A fact to be remembered.  But, alas!<br />
  They train their husbands too, and undertake<br />
  A mission to their souls, so gently pushed,<br />
  So tenderly, they may not take offence,<br />
  Or punish with rebuff; and yet, dear hearts!<br />
  With such persistence, that they reach the raw<br />
  Before they know it: so it comes to tears<br />
  At last, with comfort in an upper room.<br />
  But then&mdash;a seal is sacred to them, and a purse<br />
  Or pocket-book, though in a dressing-room<br />
  With shutters and a key!<br />

  And selfish calculation of the claims<br />
  Of one my peer, or my superior,<br />
  In every personal and moral grace,<br />
  I walked along, till, on my consciousness,<br />
  Flashed the absurdity of my conceits<br />
  And my assumptions, and I laughed outright&mdash;<br />
  Laughed at myself, so loudly and so long<br />
  That I was startled.  Not for many months<br />
  Had sound of mirth escaped me; and my voice<br />
  Rang strangely in my ears, as if the lips<br />
  Of one long dead had spoken.<br />

  The token of returning healthfulness<br />
  With warm self-gratulation.  I had touched<br />
  The magic hand that held new life for me:<br />
  The cloud was lifted, and the burden gone.<br />
  The leaf within my book of fate, that gloomed<br />
  With awful records, washed and blotched by tears&mdash;<br />
  Blown by a woman's breath from finger-tip's<br />
  They knew not what they did&mdash;was folded back;<br />
  And all the next white page held but one word,<br />
  One word of gold and flame&mdash;its title-crown&mdash;<br />
  That wrought a rosy nimbus for itself;<br />
  And that one word was LOVE.<br />

  My pride or my propriety imposed<br />
  Upon desire, before my eyes could see<br />
  The object of my new-born passion, passed;<br />
  And in the low hours of an afternoon.<br />
  Bright with the largess of kingly shower<br />
  Whose chariot-wheels still thundered in the East,<br />
  Leaving the West aflame, I sought the meads,<br />
  And once again, thrilled by foretasted joy,<br />
  Walked toward the mountain.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">

  Fell like a veil of gauze between my eyes<br />
  And the blue wall; and from the precious spot<br />
  That held the object of my thought, there sprang<br />
  An iridal effulgence, faint at first,<br />
  But brightening fast, and leaping to an arch<br />
  That spanned the heavens&mdash;a miracle of light!<br />
  "There's treasure where the rainbow rests," I said.<br />
  Would it evade me, as, for years untold,<br />
  It had evaded every childish dupe<br />
  Whose feet had chased the bright, elusive cheat?<br />
  Would it evade me?  Question that arose,<br />
  And loomed with darker front and huger form<br />
  Than the dark mountain, and more darkly loomed<br />
  And higher rose as the long path grew short!<br />
  Would it evade me?  Like a passing smile<br />
  The rainbow faded from the mountain's face;<br />
  And Hope's resplendent iris, which illumed<br />
  My question, grew phantasmal, and at length<br />
  Evanished, leaving but a doubtful blur.<br />
  Would it evade me?  Gods! what wealth or waste<br />
  Of precious life awaited the reply!<br />
  Was it a coward's shudder that o'erswept<br />
  My frame at thought of possible repulse<br />
  And possible relapse?<br />

  I heard the mistress of the cottage say<br />
  Behind a honeysuckle.  Did I smile?<br />
  It was because the fancy crossed me then<br />
  That the announcement was like one which rings<br />
  Over the polar seas, when, from his perch,<br />
  The lookout bruits a long-expected whale!<br />
  Then sweeping the piazza from the spot<br />
  Where with her niece she sat, she hailed me with:<br />
  "So, you are come at last!  How very sad<br />
  These men have so much business!  Tell me how<br />
  You got away; how soon you must return;<br />
  Who suffers by your absence; what the news,<br />
  And whether you are well."<br />

  These words to me, and timely given.  They broke<br />
  The spell of fear, and banished my restraint.<br />
  She took my arm, and led me to her niece,<br />
  Who greeted me as if some special grace<br />
  Of courtesy were due, to make amends<br />
  For the familiar badinage her aunt<br />
  Had poured upon me.<br />

  One with her work, the other with her book&mdash;<br />
  To taste the freshness of the evening air,<br />
  Washed of the hot day's dust by rain; to hear<br />
  The robin's hymn of joy; and watch the clouds<br />
  That canopied with gold the sinking sun.<br />
  The maiden in a pale-blue, muslin robe&mdash;<br />
  Dyed with forget-me-nots, I fancied then,<br />
  And sweet with life in every fold, I knew&mdash;<br />
  A blush-rose at her throat, and in her hair<br />
  A sprig of green and white, was lovelier<br />
  Than sky or landscape; and her low words fell<br />
  More musically than the robin's hymn.<br />
  So, with my back to other scene and sound,<br />
  I faced the faces, took the proffered chair<br />
  And looked and listened.<br />

  And tenderly she tried to heal the wound:<br />
  "I know that you have suffered; but your hours<br />

  In unavailing sorrow goes to waste."<br />

<p class="poem">
  "True," I replied, "but work may not be done<br />

<p class="poem">
  "A happy woman!" I exclaimed; "in truth,<br />
  The first I ever found affecting art<br />
  Who shunned expression by it.  If a girl<br />
  Like painting, she must paint; if poetry,<br />
  She must write verses.  Can you tell me why<br />
  (For sex marks no distinction in this thing).<br />
  Men with a taste for art in finest forms<br />
  Cherish the fancy that they may become,<br />
  Or are, Art's masters?  You shall see a man<br />
  Who never drew a line or struck an arc<br />
  Direct an architect, and spoil his work,<br />
  Because, forsooth! he likes a tasteful house!<br />
  He likes a muffin, but he does not go<br />
  Into his kitchen to instruct his cook,&mdash;<br />
  Nay, that were insult.  He admires fine clothes,<br />
  But trusts his tailor.  Only in those arts<br />
  Which issue from creative potencies<br />
  Does his conceit engage him.  He could learn<br />
  The baker's trade, and learn to cut a coat,<br />
  But never learn to do that one great deed<br />
  Which he essays."<br />

  These people make"&mdash;she answered, thoughtfully.<br />
  "Art gives them pleasure; and they honor those<br />
  Whose heads and hands produce it.  If they see<br />
  The length and breadth and beauty of a thought<br />
  Embodied by another,&mdash;if they hold<br />
  The taste, the culture, the capacity,<br />
  To measure values in the things of art,<br />
  Why cannot they create?  Why cannot they<br />
  Win to themselves the honor they bestow<br />
  On those who feed them?  Is it very strange<br />
  That those who know how sweet the gratitude<br />
  Which the true artist stirs, should burn to taste<br />
  That gratitude themselves?"<br />

  "How many, think you?  Only one, two, three,"<br />
  The maiden said.  "Here we have all the world<br />
  In this one cottage&mdash;artist, teacher, taught,<br />
  In&mdash;not to mar the order of the scale<br />
  For courtesy&mdash;yourself, myself, my aunt.<br />
  You are an artist, so my aunt reports;<br />
  But, as an artist, you are nought to her.<br />
  And now, to broach a petted theory,<br />
  Let me presume too boldly, while I say<br />
  She cannot understand you, though I can;<br />
  You cannot measure her, though she is wise.<br />
  You have not much for her, and that you have<br />
  You cannot teach her; but I, knowing her,<br />
  Can pick from your creations crumbs of thought<br />
  She will find manna.  In the hands of Christ<br />
  The five loaves grew, the fishes multiplied;<br />
  And he to his disciples gave the feast&mdash;<br />
  They to the multitude.  Artists are few,<br />
  Teachers are thousands, and the world is large.<br />
  Artists are nearest God.  Into their souls<br />
  He breathes his life, and from their hands it comes<br />
  In fair, articulate forms to bless the world;<br />
  And yet, these forms may never bless the world<br />
  Except its teachers take them in their hands,<br />
  And give each man his portion."<br />

  Her eyes were filled with light, and her closed book<br />
  Was pressed against her heart, whose throbbing tide<br />
  Thridded her temples.  I was half amused,<br />
  Half rapt in admiration; and she saw<br />
  That in my eyes at which she blushed and paused.<br />
  "Your pardon, Sir," she said.  "It ill becomes<br />

  "Well&mdash;if you wish it&mdash;yes:" she made reply.<br />
  "And first, my auditor must know that I<br />
  Relieve in inspiration, though he knows<br />
  So much as that already, from my words,&mdash;<br />
  Believe that God inspires the poet's soul,&mdash;<br />
  That he gives eyes to see, and ears to hear<br />
  What in his realm holds finest ministry<br />
  For highest aptitudes and needs of men,<br />
  And skill to mould it into forms of art<br />
  Which shall present it to the world he serves.<br />
  Sometimes the poet writes with fire; with blood<br />
  Sometimes; sometimes with blackest ink:<br />
  It matters not.  God finds his mighty way<br />
  Into his verse.  The dimmest window-panes<br />
  Let in the morning light, and in that light<br />
  Our faces shine with kindled sense of God<br />
  And his unwearied goodness; but the glass<br />
  Gets little good of it; nay, it retains<br />
  Its chill and grime beyond the power of light<br />
  To warm or whiten.  E'en the prophet's ass<br />
  Had better eyes than he who strode his back,<br />
  And, though the prophet bore the word of God,<br />
  Did finer reverence.  The Psalmist's soul<br />
  Was not a fitting place for psalms like his<br />
  To dwell in over-long, while waiting words,<br />
  If I read rightly.  As for the old seers,<br />
  Whose eyes God touched with vision of the life<br />
  Of the unfolding ages, I must doubt<br />
  Whether they comprehended what they saw,<br />
  Or knew what they recorded.  It remains<br />
  For the world's teachers to expound their words;<br />
  To probe their mysteries; and relegate<br />
  The truth they hold in blind significance<br />
  Into the fair domains of history<br />
  And human knowledge.  Am I understood?"<br />

<p class="poem">
  "You are," I answered; "and I cannot say<br />
  You flatter me.  God takes within his hand<br />
  A thing of his contrivance which we call<br />
  A poet: then he puts it to his lips,<br />
  And speaks his word, and puts it down again&mdash;<br />
  The instrument not better and not worse<br />
  For being handled;&mdash;not improved a whit<br />
  In quality, by quality of that<br />
  Which it conveys.  Do I report aright?<br />
  Or do you prompt me?"<br />

  She said, "at learning, but a little bald<br />
  In statement.  Nathless, be it as you say;<br />
  And we shall see how it is possible<br />
  That poets need instruction quite as much<br />
  As those for whom they write.  What sad, bad men<br />
  The brightest geniuses have been!  How weak,<br />
  How mean in character! how foul in life!<br />
  How feebly have the best of them retained<br />
  The wealth of good and beauty which has flowed<br />
  In crystal streams from God, the fountain head,<br />
  Through them to fertilize the world!  Nay, worse,<br />
  How many of them have infused the tide<br />
  With tincture of their own impurity,<br />
  To poison sweetest, unsuspecting lips,<br />
  And breed diseases in the finest blood!<br />
  And poets not alone, and not the worst;<br />
  But painters, sculptors&mdash;those whose kingly power<br />
  And aptitude for utterance divine<br />
  Have made them artists:&mdash;how have these contemned<br />
  In countless instances the God of Heaven<br />
  Who filled them with his fire!  Think you that these<br />
  Could compass their achievements of themselves?<br />
  Can streams surpass their fountains?"<br />

  In quick response, "Your argument is good;<br />
  But is the artist nothing?  Is he nought<br />
  But an apt tool&mdash;a mouth-piece for a voice?<br />
  You make him but the spigot of a cask<br />
  Round which you, teachers, wait with silver cups<br />
  To bear away the wine that leaves it dry.<br />
  You magnify your office."<br />

  She then rejoined.  "You take it at first hand,<br />
  And we from yours: the multitude from ours.<br />
  It may leach through our souls, if our poor wills<br />
  Retain it not, and drench the fragrant sand.<br />
  And if I magnify my office&mdash;well!<br />
  'Tis a great office.  What would come of all<br />
  The music of the masters, did not we<br />
  Wait at their doors, to publish to the world<br />
  What God has told them?  They would be as mute<br />
  As the dumb Sphynx.  They write a symphony,<br />
  An opera, an oratorio,<br />
  In language that the teacher understands,<br />
  And straight the whole world echoes to its strains<br />
  It shrills and thunders through cathedral glooms<br />
  From golden organ-tubes and voiceful choirs;<br />
  The halls of art of both the hemispheres<br />
  Resound with its divinest melodies;<br />
  The street stirs with the impulse, and we hear<br />
  The blare of martial trumpets, and the tramp<br />
  Of bannered armies swaying to its rhythm;<br />
  The hurdy-gurdies and the whistling boys<br />
  Adopt the lighter strains; and round and round<br />
  A million souls its hovering fancies float,<br />
  Like butterflies above a fair parterre,<br />
  Till, settling one by one, they sleep at last;<br />
  And lo! two petals more on every flower!<br />
  And this not all; for though the master die,<br />
  The teacher lives forever.  On and on,<br />
  Through all the generations, he shall preach<br />
  The beautiful evangel;&mdash;on and on,<br />
  Till our poor race has passed the tortuous years<br />
  That lie prevening the millennium,<br />
  And slid into that broad and open sea,<br />
  He shall sail singing still the songs he learned<br />
  In the world's youth, and sing them o'er and o'er<br />
  To lapping waters, till the thousand leagues<br />
  Are overpast, and argosy and crew<br />
  Ride at their port."<br />

  "And as to prophecies, most credible;<br />
  But, as an illustration, false, I think.<br />
  That which the voice and instrument may do<br />
  For the composer, types may do for those<br />
  Who mint their thoughts in verse.  Music is writ<br />
  In language that the people do not read&mdash;<br />
  Is lame in that&mdash;and needs interpreters;<br />
  While poetry, e'en in its noblest forms<br />
  And boldest flights, speaks their vernacular.<br />
  Your aunt can read the book within your hand<br />
  As well as you, if she desire, yet finds<br />
  Your score all Greek, until you vocalize<br />
  Its wealth of hidden meaning.  As for arts<br />
  Which meet the eye in picture and in form,<br />
  They ask no mediator but the light&mdash;<br />
  No grace but privilege to shine with naught<br />
  Between them and the light.  They are themselves<br />
  Expositors of that which they expose,<br />
  Or they are nothing.  All the middle-men&mdash;<br />
  The fools profound&mdash;who take it on their tongues<br />
  To play the showmen, strutting up and down,<br />
  And mouthing of the beauty that they hide,<br />
  Are an impertinence."<br />

  Still stands untouched," she added, thoughtfully,<br />
  "That greatest artists speak to fewest souls,<br />
  Or speak to them directly.  They have need<br />
  Of no such ministry as waits the beck<br />
  Of the composer; but they need the life,<br />
  If not the learning, of the cultured few<br />
  Who understand them.  If from out my book<br />
  I gather that which feeds me, and inspires<br />
  A nobler, sweeter beauty in my life,<br />
  And give my life to those who cannot win<br />
  From the dim text such boon, then have I borne<br />
  A blessing from the book, and been its best<br />
  Interpreter.  The bread that comes from heaven<br />
  Needs finest breaking.  Some there doubtless are&mdash;<br />
  Some ready souls&mdash;that take the morsel pure<br />
  Divided to their need; but multitudes<br />
  Must have it in admixtures, menstruums,<br />
  And forms that human hands or human life<br />
  Have moulded.  Though the multitudes may find<br />
  Something to stir and lift their sluggish souls<br />
  In sight of great cathedrals, or in view<br />
  Of noble pictures, yet they see not all,<br />
  And not the best.  That which they do not see<br />
  Must enter higher souls, and there, by art<br />
  Or life, be fashioned to their want."<br />

  "Now may you be forgiven!" the aunt exclaimed,<br />

  Quite to that lady's liking&mdash;of the earth.<br />
  We ate her jumbles for her, sipped her tea,<br />

  "You men are very curious," she said.<br />
  "I knew you'd ask me.  Can't a lady stir,<br />

  With whom she keeps her tryst?  'Tis an old trick,<br />

  My hostess made response; and then she laughed<br />
  A rippling, rollicking roulade, and shook<br />
  Her finger at me, till my temples burned<br />

  Illumed her features, as she gave her hand<br />
  With thought of parting.  I had rallied all<br />

  The open doorway of the humble hut<br />
  Which, far long years, had held the village school,<br />
  And, at a little distance, paused.  The room,<br />
  Battered and black by wantonest abuse<br />
  Of the rude youth, was lit by feeble lamps,<br />
  Brought by the villagers; and scattered round<br />
  Upon the high, hacked benches, hardly less<br />
  Rude and rough-worn than they, the worshippers<br />
  In silence sat.  It was no place for words.<br />
  I took the lady's hand, and said "good-night!"<br />
  In whisper.  Then she turned, and disappeared<br />
  Within the sheltered gloom; but I could see<br />
  The care-worn cheeks light up with pleasant fire<br />
  As she passed in; and e'en the fainting lamps<br />
  Flared with new life, the while they caught the breath<br />
  Of her sweet robe.  Then with an angry heart<br />
  I turned away, and, wrapped in selfish thought,<br />
  Took up the walk toward home.<br />

  Or how offensive in her piety<br />
  And her devotion to the tasteless cult<br />
  Of the weak throng, I was her slave; and she&mdash;<br />
  Her own and God's.  The miserable strife<br />
  Between my love of self and love of her<br />
  I knew was bootless; and the trenchant truth<br />
  Cut to the quick.  She held within her hand<br />
  My heart, my life, my doom, yet knew it not;<br />
  And had she known, her soul was under vows<br />
  Which would forever make subordinate<br />
  Their recognized possession.<br />

  Brought with it better mood and calmer thought:<br />
  I had the grace to gauge the heartlessness<br />
  Of my exactions, and the power to crush<br />
  The tyrant wish to tear her from the throne<br />
  To which she clung.  I said: "So she love me<br />
  As a true woman loves, and give herself&mdash;<br />
  Her sweet, pure self&mdash;to me, and fill my home<br />
  With her dear presence, loyal still to me<br />
  In wifely love and wifely offices,<br />
  Though she abide in Christian loyalty<br />
  By Christian vows, she shall have liberty,<br />
  And hold it as her right."<br />

  No weakling girl, who would surrender will<br />
  And life and reason, with her loving heart,<br />
  To her possessor;&mdash;no soft, clinging thing<br />
  Who would find breath alone within the arms<br />
  Of a strong master, and obediently<br />
  Wait on his whims in slavish carefulness;&mdash;<br />
  No fawning, cringing spaniel, to attend<br />
  His royal pleasure, and account herself<br />
  Rewarded by his pats and pretty words,<br />
  But a round woman, who, with insight keen,<br />
  Had wrought a scheme of life, and measured well<br />
  Her womanhood; had spread before her feet<br />
  A fine philosophy to guide her steps;<br />
  Had won a faith to which her life was brought<br />
  In strict adjustment&mdash;brain and heart meanwhile<br />
  Working in conscious harmony and rhythm<br />
  With the great scheme of God's great universe,<br />
  On toward her being's end.<br />

  Her motives were superior to mine.<br />
  I could but feel that in her loyalty<br />
  To God and duty, she condemned my life.<br />
  Into her woman's heart, thrown open wide<br />
  In holy charity, she had drawn all<br />
  Of human kind, and found no humblest soul<br />
  Too humble for her entertainment,&mdash;none<br />
  So weak it could return no grateful boon<br />
  For what she gave; and standing modestly<br />
  Within her scheme, with meekest reverence<br />
  She bowed to those above her, yet with strong<br />
  And hearty confidence assumed a place<br />
  In service of the world, as minister<br />
  Ordained of heaven to break to it the bread<br />
  She took from other hands.  And she was one<br />
  Who could see all there was of good in me,&mdash;<br />
  Could measure well the product of my power,<br />
  And give it impulse and direction: nay,<br />
  Could supplement my power; and help my heart<br />

  The selfish thirsting for monopoly<br />
  Of her affections from my godless heart,<br />
  She entered in, and reigned a goddess there.<br />
  If she had fascinated me before,<br />
  And fired my heart with passion, now she bent<br />
  My spirit to profound respect.  I bowed<br />
  To the fair graces of her character,<br />
  Her queenly gifts, and the beneficence<br />
  Of her devoted life, with humbled heart<br />
  And self-depreciation.  All of God<br />
  That the world held for me, I found in her;<br />
  And in her, all the God I sought.  She was<br />
  My saviour from myself and from my sins;<br />
  For, with my worship of the excellence<br />
  Which she embodied, came the purity<br />
  And peace to which, through all my troubled life,<br />
  I had been stranger.  Thoughts and feelings all<br />
  Were sublimated by the subtle flame<br />
  Which warmed and wrapped me; and I walked as one<br />
  Might walk on air, with things of earth beneath,<br />
  Breathing a rare, supernal atmosphere<br />
  Which every sense and faculty informed<br />
  With light and life divine.<br />

  Out into heaven again, their pennant-flames<br />
  The rosy dawns and day-falls.  O'er and o'er,<br />
  I walked the path, and crossed the stream, that lay<br />
  Between me and the idol of my heart;<br />
  And every day, in every circumstance,<br />
  I found her still the same, yet not the same;<br />
  For, every day, some unsuspected grace,<br />
  Or some fresh revelation of her wealth<br />
  Of character and culture, touched my heart<br />
  To new surprise, and overflowed the cup<br />
  Whose wine was life to me.<br />

  On her affection&mdash;I had given myself<br />
  So wholly to the venture for her hand,<br />

  The question which, unasked, held hopefully<br />

  She had been bred to luxury; and all<br />
  That wealth could purchase for her, or the friends<br />
  Swarmed by its golden glamour could bestow,<br />
  She had possessed.  But he who won the wealth,<br />
  Reaching for more, slipped from his height and fell<br />
  Dragging his house to ruin.  Then he died&mdash;<br />
  Died in disgrace; and all his thousand friends<br />
  Fell off, and left his pampered family,<br />
  The while the noisy auctioneer knocked down<br />
  His house and household gods, and set adrift<br />
  The helpless life thus cruelly bereft.<br />
  The mother lived a month: the rest went forth,<br />
  Not knowing whither; but they found among<br />
  The poor a shelter for their poverty,&mdash;<br />
  Kathrina with her aunt.  Thus, in few words,<br />
  A tragedy of heart-breaks and of death,<br />
  Such as the world abounds with.<br />

  Her life, thus far revealed, and waiting still<br />

  Of Autumn's opening door, I went with her<br />
  To ramble in the fields.  We touched the hem<br />
  Of the dark mountain's robe, that falls in folds<br />
  Of emerald sward around his feet, and there<br />
  Upon its tufted velvet we sat down.<br />
  It was my time to speak, but I was dumb;<br />
  And silence, painful and portentous, hung<br />
  Upon us both.  At length, she turned and said:<br />
  "Some days have passed since you were latest here.<br />
  Have you been ill?"<br />

  In the sky above and the waves below!<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the gibber and laugh went round!<br />
  The shout and the laugh of a thousand men,<br />

  "Was it a vision that cheated his eyes?<br />

<p class="poem">
  "But she came again, and every day<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the boon she could give alone.<br />

<p class="poem">
  I marked her as I read, a furtive glance<br />
  Filling each pause.  The passion of the piece,<br />
  Flaming and fading, ever and anon,<br />
  Mirrored itself within her tender eyes,<br />
  Themselves the mirror of her tender soul,<br />
  And fixed attent upon my face the while.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  She had not caught my meaning, but had heard<br />
  Only a weird, wild story.  When I paused,<br />
  Folding the manuscript, I saw a shade<br />
  Of disappointment sweep her face, and marked<br />
  A question rising in her eyes.  She knew<br />
  That I was waiting for her words, and turned<br />
  Her look away, and for long moments gazed<br />
  Into the brooding dusk.<br />

I said.<br />

<p class="poem">
  "'Twas very strange and sad," she answered me.<br />
  "Why do you write such things?&mdash;or, writing such,<br />
  Leave them so incomplete?  The prisoned youth,<br />
  Thus unreleased, will haunt me while I live.<br />
  I shudder while I think of him."<br />

  No fact that it records.  Whether this youth<br />
  Shall live entombed, or reach the blessed air,<br />

  I hear him call, and call again her name<br />
  Kathrina!  O!  Kathrina!"<br />

  Of the hot lightning, the significance<br />
  Of the strange vision gleamed upon her face<br />
  In a bright, throbbing flame, that fell full soon<br />
  To ashen paleness.  By unconscious will<br />
  We both arose.  She vainly tried to speak,<br />
  And gazed into my eyes with such a look<br />
  Of tender questioning, of half-reproach,<br />
  Of struggling, doubting, hesitating joy,<br />
  As few men ever see, and none but once.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Are there not lofty moments, when the soul<br />
  Leaps to the front of being, casting off<br />
  The robes and clumsy instruments of sense,<br />
  And, postured in its immortality,<br />
  Reveals its independence of the clod<br />
  In which it dwells?&mdash;moments in which the earth<br />
  And all material things, all sights and sounds,<br />
  All signals, ministries, interpreters,<br />
  Relapse to nothing, and the interflow<br />
  Of thought and feeling, love and life go on<br />
  Between two spirits, raised to sympathy<br />
  By an inspiring passion, as, in heaven,<br />
  The body dust, within an orb outlived,<br />
  It shall go on forever?<br />

  Nay, these in very truth&mdash;were given us then.<br />
  Who shall expound&mdash;ah! who but God alone,<br />
  The everlasting mystery of love?<br />
  She spoke not, but I knew that she was mine.<br />
  I breathed no word, but she was well assured<br />
  That I was wholly hers.<br />

  Our love had hid, and wrought its miracle;<br />
  Behind what semblance of indifference,<br />
  Or play of courtesy, it spun the cords<br />
  That bound our hearts in one, was mystery<br />
  Like love itself.  The swift intelligence<br />
  Of interchange of perfect faith and troth,<br />
  Of gift of life and person, of the thrill<br />
  Of triumph in my soul and gratitude<br />
  In hers, without a gesture, or a word,<br />
  Was like the converse of the continents<br />
  Tracking with voiceless flight the slender wire<br />
  That underlay the throbbing mystery<br />
  Between our souls, and made our heart-beats one.<br />
  I opened wide my arms, and she, my own,<br />
  Sobbed on my breast with such excess of joy,<br />
  In such embrace of passionate tenderness,<br />
  As heaven may yield again, but never earth.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Slow in the golden twilight, toward her home,<br />
  Her hand upon my arm, we loitered on,<br />
  Silent at first, and then with quiet speech<br />
  Broaching our plans, or tracing in review<br />
  The history of our springing love, when she,<br />
  Lifting her soft blue eyes to mine:<br />

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Paul!<br />
  There are some things, and some I will not name,<br />
  That make me sad, e'en in this height of joy.<br />
  In the wild lay that you have read to-night,<br />
  You make too much of me.  No heart of man,<br />
  Though loving well and loving worthily,<br />
  Can be content with any human love.<br />
  No woman, though the pride and paragon<br />
  Of all her sex, can take the place of God.<br />
  No angel she: nor is she quite a man<br />
  In power and courage,&mdash;gifts which charm her most<br />
  And which, possessing most, disrobe her charms,<br />
  And make her less a woman.  If she stand<br />
  In fair equality with man&mdash;his mate&mdash;<br />
  Each unto each the rounded complement<br />
  Of their humanity, it is enough;<br />
  And such equality must ever lie<br />
  In their unequal gifts.  This thing, at least,<br />
  Is true as God: she is not more than he,<br />
  And sits upon no throne.  To be adored<br />
  By man, she must be placed upon a throne<br />
  Built by his hands, and sit an idol there,<br />
  Degraded by the measure of the flight<br />
  Between God's thought and man's."<br />

  "Fix your own place, my love; it is your right,<br />
  'Tis well to have a theory, and sit<br />
  In the centre of it, mistress of its law,<br />
  And subject also;&mdash;to set men up here<br />
  And women there, in a fine equipoise<br />
  Of gift and grace and import.  It conveys<br />
  To nicely-working minds a pleasant sense<br />
  Of order, like a well-appointed room,<br />
  Where one may see, in various stuffs and wares,<br />
  Forethoughts of color brought to harmony;<br />
  Strict balancings of quantity and form;<br />
  Flowers in the centre, and, beside the grate,<br />
  A rack for shovel and tongs.  But minds like these<br />
  (Your pardon, love!) are likely to arrange<br />
  The window-lights to save the furniture,<br />
  And spoil the pictures on the wall.  And you,<br />
  In the adjustment of your theory,<br />
  Would shut the light from her whose mind informs<br />
  Its harmonies.  All worship, in my thought,<br />
  Goes hand in hand with love.  We cannot love,<br />
  And fail to worship what we love.  While you<br />
  Worship the strength and courage which you find<br />
  In him who has your heart, he bows to all<br />
  Of faith and sweetness which he finds in you.<br />
  If, in our worship, we have need to build<br />
  Noblest ideals, taking much from God<br />
  With which to make them perfect in our eyes,<br />
  Shall God mark blame?  We worship him the while,<br />
  In attributes his own, or attributes<br />
  With which our thought invests him.  As for me&mdash;<br />
  It is no secret&mdash;I am what you call<br />
  A godless man; yet what is worshipful,<br />
  Or seems to be so, that with all my heart<br />
  I worship; and I worship while I love.<br />
  You deem yourself the dwelling-place of God,<br />
  And keep your spirit cleanly for his feet.<br />
  All merit you abjure, ascribing all<br />
  To him who dwells within you.  How can you<br />
  Forbid that I fall down and worship you,<br />
  When what I find to worship is not yours,<br />
  But God's alone?  I know the ecstasy<br />
  Enlarges, strengthens, purifies my soul,<br />
  And blesses me with peace.  My love, my life,<br />
  You are my all.  I have no other good,<br />
  And, in this moment of my happiness,<br />
  I ask no other."<br />

  Her clasped hands clinging fondly to my arm,<br />
  While under droop of lashes she replied:<br />
  "I feel, dear Paul, that this is sophistry.<br />
  It does not touch my judgment or my heart<br />
  With motive of conviction.  In what way<br />
  God may be working to reclaim your will<br />
  And worship to himself, I cannot know.<br />
  If through your love for me, or mine for you,<br />
  Then, as his grateful, willing instrument,<br />
  I yield myself to him.  But this is true:<br />
  God is not worshipped in his attributes.<br />
  I do not love your attributes, but you.<br />
  Your attributes all meet me otherwhere,<br />
  Blended in other personalities,<br />
  Nor do I love, nor do I worship them,<br />
  Or those who bear them.  E'en the spotted pard<br />
  Will dare a danger which will make you pale,<br />
  But shall his courage steal my heart from you?<br />
  You cheat your conscience, for you know that I<br />
  May like your attributes, yet love not you;<br />
  Nay, worship them indeed, despising you.<br />
  I do not argue this to damp your joy,<br />
  But make it rational.  If you presume<br />
  Perfection in me,&mdash;if you lavish all<br />
  The largess of your worship and your love<br />
  On me, imposing on my head a crown<br />
  Stolen from God's, there surely waits your heart<br />
  The pang of disappointment.  There will come<br />
  A sad, sad time, when, in your famished soul,<br />
  The cry for something more, and more divine,<br />
  Will rise, nor be repressed."<br />

  In earnestness, when it inspires the lips<br />
  Of one we love, that spoils their argument,<br />

  That the conviction which they seek evades<br />
  Their eager fingers, and with throbbing wings<br />

  Cunning and clear; and I was proud of her;<br />
  And though I knew that she had swept away<br />
  My refuges of lies like chaff, and proved<br />
  My fair words fustian, I was moved to mirth<br />
  Over the solemn ruin.  Had it been<br />
  A decent thing to do, I should have laughed<br />
  Full in her face; but knowing that her words<br />
  Were offspring of her conscience and her love,<br />
  I could no less than hold respectfully<br />
  Her earnest warning.<br />

  I will have you, who, on the whole, I like<br />
  Better than that.  And you shall have your way,<br />
  And I my own, in common liberty,<br />
  With things like these.  You, doubtless, are to me<br />
  What I am not to you.  We are unlike<br />
  In life and circumstance&mdash;alike alone<br />
  In this: that better than all else on earth<br />
  We love each other.  This is basis broad<br />
  For happiness, or broad enough for me.<br />
  If you build better, you are fortunate,<br />
  Ay, fortunate indeed; and some fine day<br />
  We'll talk about it.  Let us have to-night<br />
  Joy in our new possessions, and defer<br />

  Awaited our return.  So, hand in hand,<br />
  Assuming show of rustic bashfulness,<br />
  We paused before her, and with bows profound<br />
  Made our obeisance.<br />

<p class="poem">
  "At what you see: and this! and this!" I said,<br />

  I've seen it from the first," she answered me.<br />
  "No doubt you thought that you were very deep,<br />
  Very mysterious&mdash;all that sort of thing.<br />
  I've watched you, and if you, young man, had been<br />
  Aught but a coward, it had come before,<br />
  And saved some sleep o' nights to both of you.<br />
  But down upon your knees, for benison<br />
  Of one who loves you both."<br />

  She kissed us, leaving on our cheeks the tear<br />
  That sprang to brim the moment.  Her shrewd eyes<br />
  That melted in the sympathy of love,<br />
  Would not meet ours again, but turned away,<br />
  And sought in solitude to drain themselves<br />

  Which burns upon that altar is of God.<br />
  Its tongues of flame, throughout all time and space,<br />
  Speak but one language, understood by all,<br />
  But sacred ever to the wedded hearts<br />
  That listen to their breathings.<br />

  I left the cottage, brain and heart o'erfilled<br />
  With the ethereal vintage I had quaffed.<br />
  Disturbing not the drowsy ferryman,<br />
  I slipped his little wherry from the sand,<br />
  And in the star-sprent river lipped the oars<br />
  That pulled me homeward.  The enchanting tide<br />
  Was smooth continuation of the dream<br />
  On which my spirit, holily afloat,<br />
  Had glided through long hours of happiness.<br />
  Earth, by the strange, delicious ecstasy,<br />
  Was changed to paradise; and something kin<br />
  To gratitude arose within my soul&mdash;<br />
  A fleeting passion, dying all too soon,<br />
  Lacking the root which faith alone can feed.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I touched the shore; but when my hasting feet<br />
  Started the homeward walk, there came a change.<br />
  Down from the quiet stars there fell a voice,<br />
  Heard in the innermost, that troubled me:<br />
  "She is not more than you: why worship her?<br />
  And she will die: what will remain for you?<br />
  You may die first, indeed: then what resource?<br />
  You have no sympathy with her in things<br />
  Ordained within, her conscience and her life<br />
  The things supreme: can there be marriage thus?<br />
  Is e'en such bliss as may be possible<br />
  Sure to be yours?  Fate has a thousand hands<br />
  To dash your lifted cup."<br />

  A vague uneasiness invaded me,<br />
  And toned the triumph of my passion, till,<br />
  Almost in anger, I exclaimed at last:<br />
  "This is reaction.  I have flown too high<br />
  Above the healthy level, and I feel<br />
  The press of denser air.  The equipoise<br />
  Of circumstance and feeling will be reached<br />
  All in good time.  Rest and to-morrow's sun<br />
  Will bring the remedy, and, with the mists,<br />
  This cloud will pass away."<br />

  I swore I would be happy,&mdash;that my soul<br />
  Should find its satisfaction in her love;<br />
  And that, if there should ever come a time<br />
  Of cold satiety, or I should find<br />
  Weakness or fault where I had thought was strength<br />
  And full perfection, I would e'en endow<br />
  Her poverty with all the hoarded wealth<br />
  Of my imagination, making her<br />
  The woman of my want, in plenitude<br />
  Of strength and loveliness.<br />

  Over whose waves my buoyant life careered,<br />
  Rolled to October, falling on its beach<br />
  With bursts of mellow music; and I leaped<br />
  Upon the longed-for shore; for, in that month,<br />
  My dear betrothed, deferring to the stress<br />
  Of my impatient wish, had promised me<br />
  Her hand in wedlock.<br />

  Dawned on the world, the world was draped in robes<br />
  Meet for the nuptials.  Baths of sunny haze,<br />
  Steeping the ripened leaves from day to day,<br />
  And dainty kisses of the frost at night,<br />
  Joined in the subtile alchemy that wrought<br />
  Such miracles of change, that myriad trees<br />
  Which pranked the meads and clothed the forest glooms<br />
  Bloomed with the tints of Eden.  Had the earth<br />
  Been splashed with blood of grapes from every clime,<br />
  Tinted from topaz to dim carbuncle,<br />
  Or orient ruby, it would not have been<br />
  Drenched with such waste of color.  All the hues<br />
  The rainbow knows, and all that meet the eye<br />
  In flowers of field and garden, joined to tell<br />
  Each tree's close-folded secret.  Side by side<br />
  Rose sister maples, some in amber gold,<br />
  Others incarnadine or tipped with flame;<br />
  And oaks that for a hundred years had stood,<br />
  And flouted one another through the storms&mdash;<br />
  Boasting their might&mdash;proclaimed their pique or pride<br />
  In dun, or dyes of Tyre.  The sumac-leaves<br />
  Blazed with such scarlet that the crimson fruit<br />
  Which hung among their flames was touched to guise<br />
  Of dim and dying embers; while the hills<br />
  That met the sky at the horizon's rim&mdash;<br />
  Dabbled with rose among the evergreens,<br />
  Or stretching off in sweeps of clouted crimson&mdash;glowed<br />
  As if the archery of sunset clouds,<br />
  By squads and fierce battalions, had rained down<br />
  Its barbed and feathered fire, and left it fast<br />
  To advertise th' exploit.<br />

  Of autumn glory, by the simplest rites,<br />
  Kathrina gave her hand to me, and I<br />
  Pledged truth and life to her.  I bore her home<br />
  Through shocks of maize, revealing half their gold;<br />
  Past gazing harvesters with creaking wains<br />
  That brimmed with fruitage&mdash;my adored, my wife,<br />
  Fruition of my hope&mdash;the proudest freight<br />

  Grown strangely warm and strangely numerous<br />
  With scent of novelty and pleasant cheer,<br />
  Assisted me to place upon her throne<br />
  My household queen.  Right royally she sat<br />
  The new-born dignity.  Most graciously<br />
  She spoke and smiled among the silken clouds<br />
  That, fold on perfumed fold, like frankincense<br />
  Enveloped her, through half the festal night,<br />
  With welcome and good wishes.  I was proud:<br />
  For was not I a king where she was queen?<br />
  And queen she was&mdash;though consort in my home,<br />
  Queen regnant in the realm of womanhood,<br />
  By right of every charm.<br />

  And, having joined them well, were satisfied.<br />
  Obedient to the orbit of our love,<br />

  From room to room, in busy household cares,<br />
  Timed with my heart, and filled me with a sense<br />
  Of harmony and peace.  Days, weeks, and months<br />
  Lapsed like soft measures, rhyming each with each.<br />
  All charged with thoughtful ministries to me,<br />
  And not to me alone; for I was proud<br />
  To know that she was counted by the good<br />
  As a good power among them,&mdash;by the poor,<br />
  As angel sent of God, on whom they called<br />
  His blessing down.<br />

  Of prayer and Christian service, without show<br />
  Of sanctity, without obtrusiveness;<br />
  And, though I could but know she never sought<br />
  A blessing for herself, forgetting me<br />
  In her petition, not in all those months<br />
  Did word of difference betray the gulf<br />
  Between our souls and lives.  She had her plan:<br />
  I guessed it, and respected it.  She felt<br />
  That if her life were not an argument<br />
  To move me, nothing that her lips might say<br />
  Could win me to her wish.  Pride would repel<br />
  What it could not refute, and pleasantry<br />
  Parry the thrusts that love could not resent.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  A whole year sped, yet not a line of verse<br />
  Had grown beneath my pen.  When I essayed<br />
  To brace my powers to effort, and to call<br />
  Forth from their camp and covert the bright ranks<br />
  Of tuneful numbers, no responsive shout<br />
  Answered the bugle-blast, and from my hand&mdash;<br />
  Irresolute and nerveless as a babe's&mdash;<br />
  My falchion fell.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rallied me on this;<br />
  But I had nought to say, save this, perhaps:<br />
  That she, being all my world, had left no room<br />
  For other occupation than my love.<br />
  She did not smile at this: it was no jest,<br />
  But saddest truth.  I had grown enervate<br />
  In the warm atmosphere which I had breathed;<br />
  And this, with consciousness that in her soul&mdash;<br />
  As warm with love as mine&mdash;each gentle power<br />
  Was kindling with new life from day to day,<br />
  Growing with my decline.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, in good time,<br />
  There came to us a child, the miniature<br />
  Of her on whose dear breast my babyhood<br />
  Was nursed and cradled; and my happy heart.<br />
  Charged with a double tenderness, received<br />
  And blessed the precious gift.  Another fount<br />
  Of human love gurgled to meet my lips.<br />
  Another store of good, as rich and pure,<br />
  In its own kind, as that from which I drank,<br />
  Was thus discovered to my taste, and I<br />
  Feasted upon its fulness.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the gift<br />
  That brimmed my cup of joy, there came a grace<br />
  To her who bore it of fresh loveliness.<br />
  If I had loved the maiden and the bride,<br />
  The mother, through whose pain my heart had won<br />
  Its new possession, fastened to my heart<br />
  With a new sympathy.  Whatever dross<br />
  Our months of intimacy had betrayed<br />
  Within her character, was purged away,<br />
  And she was left pure gold.  Nay, I should say,<br />
  Whatever goodness had not been revealed<br />
  Through the relations of her heart to mine<br />
  As loving maid and mistress, found the light<br />
  Through her maternity.  A heavenly change<br />
  Passed o'er her soul and o'er her pallid face,<br />
  As if the unconscious yearning of a life<br />
  Had found full satisfaction in the birth<br />
  Of the new being.  Her long weariness<br />
  Was but a trance of peace and gratitude;<br />
  And as she lay&mdash;her babe upon her breast,<br />
  Her eyelids closed&mdash;I could but feel that heaven,<br />
  Should it hold all the good of which she dreamed<br />
  Had little more for her.<br />

  She moved about the house, in ministry<br />
  To me and to her helpless child, I knew<br />
  That I had tasted every precious good<br />
  That woman bears to man.  Ay, more than this:<br />
  That not one man in thousands had received<br />
  Such largess of affection, and such prize<br />
  Of womanhood, as I had found in her,<br />
  And made my own.  The whole enchanting round<br />
  Of pure, domestic commerce had been mine.<br />
  A lover blest, a husband satisfied,<br />
  A father crowned!  Love had no other boon<br />
  To offer me, and held within its gift<br />
  No other title.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, within the space<br />
  Of two swift years, I traversed the domain<br />
  Of novelty, and learned that I must glean<br />
  The garnered fields of my experience<br />
  To gratify the greed that still possessed<br />
  My sateless heart.  The time had come to me&mdash;<br />
  Which I had half foreseen&mdash;when, by my will,<br />
  My interest in those I loved should live<br />
  Predominant in all my life.  I nursed<br />
  With jealous care my passion for my wife.<br />
  I raised her to an apotheosis<br />
  In my imagination, where I bowed<br />
  And paid my constant homage.  I was still<br />
  Her fond and loyal lover; but my heart,<br />
  That had so freely drunk, with full content,<br />
  Had seen the bottom of the cup she held;<br />
  And what remained but tricks to eke it out,<br />
  And artifice to give it piquancy,<br />
  And sips to cool my tongue, the while my heart<br />
  Was hollow with its thirst?  My little child<br />
  Was precious to my soul beyond all price;<br />
  Mother and babe were all that they could be<br />
  To any heart of man; and yet&mdash;and yet!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Of all the dull, dead weights man ever bore,<br />
  Sure, none can wear the soul with discontent<br />
  Like consciousness of power unused.  To feel<br />
  That one has gift to move the multitude,&mdash;<br />
  To act upon the life of humankind<br />
  By force of will, or fire of eloquence,<br />
  Or voice of lofty art, and yet, to feel<br />
  No stir of mighty motive in the soul<br />
  To action or endeavor; to behold<br />
  The fairest prizes of this fleeting life<br />
  Borne off by patient men who, day by day,<br />
  By bravest toil and struggle, reach the heights<br />
  Of great achievement, toiling, struggling thus<br />
  With a strong joy, and with a fine contempt<br />
  For soft and selfish passion; to see this,<br />
  Yet cling to such a passion, like a slave<br />
  Who hugs his chains in sluggish impotence,<br />
  Refusing freedom lest he lose the crust<br />
  The chain of bondage warrants him&mdash;ah! this<br />
  Is misery indeed!<br />

  Was mine.  I held the consciousness of power<br />
  To labor even-headed with the best<br />
  Who wrought for fame, or strove to make themselves<br />
  Felt in the world's great life; and yet, I felt<br />
  No lift to enterprise, from heaven above<br />
  Or earth beneath; for neither God nor man<br />
  Lived in my love.  My home held all my world;<br />
  Yet it was evident&mdash;I felt, I knew&mdash;<br />
  That nought could fill my opening want but toil;<br />
  And there were times when I had hailed with joy<br />
  The curse of poverty, compelling me<br />
  To labor for my bread, and for the bread<br />
  Of those I loved.<br />

  Were happy in their work.  The plodding hind<br />
  Who served my hand, or groomed my petted horse.<br />
  Whistled about his work with merry heart,<br />
  And filled his measure of content with toil.<br />
  In all the streets and all the busy fields,<br />
  Men were astir, and doing with their might<br />
  What their hands found to do.  They drove the plough,<br />
  They trafficked, builded, delved, they spun and wove,<br />
  They taught and preached, they hasted up and down<br />
  Each on his little errand, and their eyes<br />
  Were full of eager fire, as if the earth<br />
  And all its vast concerns were on their hands.<br />
  Their homes were fresh with guerdon every night,<br />
  And ripe with impulse to new industry<br />
  At each new dawn.<br />

  That they were not like me&mdash;were most unlike<br />
  In constitution and condition.  Thus,<br />
  My power to do, and do the single thing<br />
  My power was shaped to do, became, instead<br />
  Of wings to bear me, weights to burden me.<br />
  The moiling multitude for little tasks<br />
  Found little motives plenty; but for me,<br />
  Who in my indolence they all despised&mdash;<br />
  Not understanding me&mdash;no motive rose<br />
  To lash or lead.  Even the Jove I dreamed<br />
  Would give me impulse had defrauded me.<br />
  Feeble and proud; strong, yet emasculate;<br />
  Centred in self, and still despising self;<br />
  Goaded, yet held; convinced, but never moved?<br />
  Such conflict ofttimes held and harried me<br />
  That death had met with welcome.  If I read,<br />
  I read to kill my time.  No interest<br />
  In the great thoughts of others moved my soul,<br />
  Because I had no object; useless quite<br />
  The knowledge and the culture I possessed;<br />
  And if I rode, the stale monotony<br />
  Of the familiar landscapes sickened me.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In these dull years, my toddling little wean<br />
  Grew into prattling childhood, and I gained<br />
  Such fresh delight from her as kept my heart<br />
  From fatal gloom; but more and more I shunned<br />
  The world around me, more and more drew in<br />
  The circle of my life, until, at last,<br />
  My home became my hermitage.  I knew<br />
  The dissolution of the spell would come,<br />
  And, though I dreaded it, I longed to greet<br />
  The crash and transformation.  If my pride<br />
  Forbade the full confession to my wife<br />
  That time had verified her prophecy,<br />
  It failed to hold the truth from her.  She read,<br />
  With a true woman's insight, all my heart;<br />
  But with a woman's sensitiveness shrank<br />
  From questions which might seem to carry blame;<br />
  And so, for years, there lay between our souls<br />
  The bar of silence.<br />

  After my lamb was folded and before<br />
  The lamps were lighted, as I sat alone<br />
  Within my room, I heard reluctant feet<br />
  Seeking my door.  They paused, and then I heard:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "May I come in?"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">

</p>

<p class="poem">
  The room was dim, but I could see her face<br />
  Was pale, and her long lashes wet.  "Your seat"&mdash;<br />
  I said, with open arms.  Upon my knee,<br />
  One hand upon my shoulder, she sank down<br />
  As if the heart within her breast were lead,<br />
  And she were weary with its weight.<br />
</p>

  What burden now?" I asked her tenderly.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  She fixed her swimming eyes on mine, and said:<br />
  "My dear, you are not happy.  Years have gone<br />
  Since you have been content.  I bring no words<br />
  Of blame against you: you have been to me<br />
  A comfort and a joy.  Your constancy<br />
  Has honored me as few of all my sex<br />
  Are honored by your own; but while you pine<br />
  With secret pain, I am so wholly yours<br />
  That I must pine with you.  I've waited long<br />
  For you to speak; and now I come to you<br />
  To ask you this one question: Is there aught<br />
  Of toil or sacrifice within my power<br />
  To ease your heart, or give you liberty<br />
  Beyond the round to which you hold your feet?<br />
  Speak freely, frankly, as to one who loves<br />
  Her husband better than her only child,<br />
  And better than herself."<br />

  Down to my cheek, and said: "My angel wife!<br />
  Whatever torment or disquietude<br />
  I may have suffered, you have never been<br />
  Its cause, or its occasion.  You are all&mdash;<br />
  You have been all&mdash;that womanhood can be<br />
  To manhood's want; and in your woman's love<br />
  And woman's pain, I have found every good<br />
  My life has known since first our lives were joined.<br />
  You knew me better than I knew myself;<br />
  And your prophetic words have haunted me<br />
  Like thoughts of retribution: '<i>There will come<br />
  'A sad, sad time, when in your famished soul<br />
  'The cry for something more, and more divine<br />
  'Will rise, nor be repressed.</i>'  For something more<br />
  My spirit clamors: nothing more divine<br />
  I ask for."<br />

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What shall be this 'something more'?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Work," I replied; "ay, work, but never here;<br />
  Work among men, where I may feel the touch<br />
  Of kindred life; work where the multitudes<br />
  Are surging; work where brains and hands<br />
  Are struggling for the prizes of the world;<br />
  Work where my spirit, driven to its bent<br />
  By competitions and grand rivalries,<br />
  Shall vindicate its own pre-eminence,<br />
  And wring from a reluctant world the meed<br />
  Of approbation and respect for which<br />
  It yearns with awful hunger; work, indeed,<br />
  Which shall compel the homage of the souls<br />
  That creep around me here, and pity you<br />
  Because, forsooth, the Fates have hobbled you<br />
  With a dull drone.  I know how sweet the love<br />
  Of two fond souls; and I will have the hearts<br />
  Of millions.  These shall satisfy my greed,<br />
  And round the measure of my life; and these<br />
  My work shall win me."<br />

  She raised her head, and with a sweet, sad smile<br />
  Of love and pity blent, made her response:<br />
  "Not yet, my husband&mdash;if your wife may speak<br />
  A thought that crosses yours&mdash;not yet have you<br />
  Found the great secret of content.  But work<br />
  May help you toward it, and in any case<br />
  Is better far than idleness.  For this,<br />
  You ask of me to sacrifice this home<br />
  And all the truest friends my life has gained.<br />
  I do it from this moment; glad to prove,<br />
  At any tender cost, my love for you,<br />
  And faith in your endeavor.  I will go<br />
  To any spot of earth where you may lead,<br />
  And go rejoicing.  Let us go at once!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I burn my ships behind me," I replied.<br />
  "Measure the cost: be sure no secret hope<br />
  Of late return be found among the flames;<br />
  For, if I go, I leave no single thread,<br />
  Save that which binds me to my mother's grave.<br />
  To draw me back."<br />

  To light the fire," she answered.<br />

  And, with a kiss, marked a full period<br />
  To love's excess, and with a sweet embrace<br />
  Wrote the initial of a stronger life.<br />

  PART III.

<h3>
  LABOR.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Ten years of love!&mdash;a sleep, a pleasant dream<br />
  That passed its culmen in the early half,<br />
  Concluding in confusion&mdash;a wild scene<br />
  Of bargains, auctions, partings, and what not?&mdash;<br />
  And an awaking!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in Broadway,<br />
  A unit in a million.  Like a bath<br />
  In ocean surf, blown in from farthest seas<br />
  Under the August ardors, the grand rush<br />
  Of crested life assailed me with its waves,<br />
  And cooled me while it fired.  With sturdy joy<br />
  I sought its broadest billows, and resigned<br />
  My spirit to their surge and sway; or stood<br />
  In sheltered coves, reached only by the spume<br />
  And crepitant bubbles of the yesty floods,<br />
  Drinking the roar, the sheen, the restlessness,<br />
  As inspiration, both of sense and soul.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I saw the waves of life roll up the steps<br />
  Of great cathedrals and retire; and break<br />
  In charioted grandeur at the feet<br />
  Of marble palaces, and toss their spray<br />
  Of feathered beauty through the open doors,<br />
  To pile the restless foam within; and burst<br />
  On crowded caravansaries, to fall<br />
  In quick return; and in dark currents glide<br />
  Through sinuous alleys and the grimy loops<br />
  Of reeking cellars; and with softest plash<br />
  Assail the gilded shrines of opulence,<br />
  And slide in musical relapse away.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  With senses dazed and stunned, and soul o'erfilled<br />
  With chaos of new thoughts, I turned away,<br />
  And sought my city home.  There all was calm,<br />
  With wife and daughter waiting my return,<br />
  And eager with their welcome.  That was life!&mdash;<br />
  An interest in the great world of life,<br />
  A place for toil within a world of toil,<br />
  And love for its reward.  "Amen!" I said,<br />
  "And twice amen!  I've found my life at last,<br />
  And we will all be happy."<br />

  The while I sought adjustment to the life<br />
  Which I had chosen, and with careful thought<br />
  Gathered to hand the fair material<br />
  Elect by Fancy for the organism<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day<br />
  I met some face I knew.  My college friends<br />
  Came up in strange disguises.  Here was one,<br />
  With a white neck-cloth and a saintly face,<br />
  Who had been rusticated and disgraced<br />
  For lawlessness.  Now he administered<br />
  A charge which proved that he had been at work,<br />
  And made himself a man.  And there was one&mdash;<br />
  A lumpy sort of boy, as memory<br />
  Recalled him to me&mdash;grown to portliness<br />
  And splendid spectacles.  He drove a chaise,<br />
  And practised surgery,&mdash;was on his way<br />
  To meet a class of youth, who sought to be<br />
  Great surgeons like himself, and took full notes<br />
  Of all his stolen wisdom.  By his watch&mdash;<br />
  A gold repeater, with a mighty chain&mdash;<br />
  He gave me just five minutes; then rolled off&mdash;-<br />
  Pretension upon wheels.  Another grasped<br />
  My hand as if I were his bosom friend,<br />
  Just in from a long voyage.  He was one<br />
  Who stole my wood in college, and received<br />
  With grace the kick I gave him.  He had grown<br />
  To be the tail of a portentous firm<br />
  Of city lawyers: managed, as he said,<br />
  The matter of collections; and had made<br />
  In his small way&mdash;to use his modest phrase,<br />
  Truthful as modest&mdash;quite a pretty plum.<br />
  He was o'erjoyed to see me in the town:<br />
  Hoped I would call upon him at his den:<br />
  If I had any business in his line,<br />
  Would do it for me promptly; as for price,<br />
  No need to talk of that between two friends!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But these, and all&mdash;the meanest and the best&mdash;<br />
  Were hard at work.  They always questioned me<br />
  Before we parted, touching my pursuits;<br />
  And though they questioned kindly, I grew sore<br />
  Under the repetition, and ashamed<br />
  To iterate my answer, till I burned<br />
  To do some work, so lifted into fame,<br />
  That shame should be to him whose ignorance<br />
  Compelled a question.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simplest foresters<br />
  Have learned the trick of woodland broods, that fly<br />
  In radiant divergence from the flash<br />
  Of death and danger, and, when all is still,<br />
  Steal back to where their fellows bit the dust<br />
  For rendezvous.  And thus society<br />
  Follows the brutal instinct.  When the friends,<br />
  Who from her father's ruin fled amain,<br />
  Found out my wife, and learned that it was safe<br />
  To gather back to the old feeding-ground,<br />
  They came.  Her old home had become my own<br />
  And they were all delighted.  It was sweet<br />
  To have her back again; and it was sad<br />
  To know that those who once were happy there,<br />
  Dispensing happiness, could come no more.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It had its modicum of earnestness,&mdash;<br />
  This talk of theirs&mdash;and she received it all<br />
  With hearty courtesy, and yielded it<br />
  The unction of her charity, so far<br />
  That it was smooth and redolent to her.<br />
  The difference&mdash;the world-wide difference&mdash;<br />
  Between my wife and them was obvious;<br />
  But she was generous through nature's gift<br />
  I fancied&mdash;could not well be otherwise;<br />
  Although their fawning filled me with disgust.<br />
  Oh! fool and blind! not to perceive the Christ<br />
  That shone and spoke in her!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hour approached&mdash;<br />
  The predetermined time&mdash;when I should close<br />
  My study door, and wrap my kindling brain<br />
  In the poetic dream which, day by day,<br />
  Was gathering consistence in my brain.<br />
  The quick, creative instinct in me plumed<br />
  Its pinions for the flight, and I could feel<br />
  The influx of fresh power; but whence it<br />
  I did not question; though it fired my heart<br />
  With the assurance of success.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told<br />
  My dear companion of my hopeful plans<br />
  For winning fame, and making for myself<br />
  A lofty place; but I could not inspire<br />
  Her heart with my ambition, or win o'er<br />
  Her judgment to my motive.  She adhered<br />
  To her old theory, and gave no room<br />
  To any motive it did not embrace.<br />
  We argued much, but always argued wide,<br />
  And ended where we started.  Postulates<br />
  On which we stood in perfect harmony,<br />
  Were points of separation, out from which<br />
  We struck divergently, till sympathy,<br />
  That only lives by rhythm of thoughts and hearts,<br />
  Lay dead between us.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Man loves praise," I said.<br />
  "It is an appetence which He who made<br />
  The human soul, made to be satisfied.<br />
  It is a tree He planted.  If it grow<br />
  On that which feeds it, and become at last<br />
  Thrifty and fruitful, it is still His own,<br />
  With usury.  And if, in His intent,<br />
  This passion have no place among the powers<br />
  Of active life, why is it mighty there<br />
  From youngest childhood?  Pray you what is fame<br />
  But concrete praise?&mdash;the universal voice<br />
  Which bears, from every quarter of the earth.<br />
  Its homage to a name, that grows thereby<br />
  To be its own immortal monument<br />
  Outlasting all the marble and the bronze<br />
  Which cunning fingers, since the world began,<br />
  Have shaped or stamped with story?  What is fame<br />
  But aggregate of praise?  And if it be<br />
  Legitimate to win, for sake of praise,<br />
  The praise of one, why not of multitudes?"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Ay," she replied; "'tis true that men love praise<br />
  And it is true that He who made the soul<br />
  Planted therein the love of praise, to be<br />
  A motive in its life&mdash;all true so far?<br />
  And so far we agree.  But motives all<br />
  Have their appropriate sphere and sway, like men<br />
  Who bear them in their breasts.  The love of praise<br />
  Fills life with fine amenities.  Not all<br />
  Who live have pleasant tempers, and not all<br />
  The gift of gracious manners, or the love<br />
  Of nobler motive, higher meed than praise.<br />
  The world is full of bears, who smooth their hair,<br />
  And glove their paws, and put on manly airs,<br />
  And hold our honey sacred, and our lives<br />
  Our own, because they hunger for our praise.<br />
  'Tis a fine thing for bears&mdash;this love of praise&mdash;<br />
  And those who deal with them; and a good thing<br />
  For children, and for parents, teachers&mdash;all<br />
  Who have them in their keeping.  It may hold<br />
  A little mind to rectitude, until<br />
  It grow, and grow ashamed to yield itself<br />
  To such a petty motive.  Children all<br />
  Like sugar, and it may admit of doubt<br />
  Whether our praise or sugar sweetens more<br />
  Their petulant sub-acids; but a man<br />
  Would choke in swallowing the compliment<br />
  Which we should pay him, were we but to say<br />
  'Go to!  Do some great deed, and you shall have<br />
  Your pay in sugar:&mdash;maple, mind you, now,<br />
  So you shall do it featly.'"<br />

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good!"<br />
  I answered, "very good, indeed! if we<br />
  Engage in talk for sport; but argument<br />
  On themes like these must have the element<br />
  Of candor.  Highest truth, in certain lights,<br />
  May be ridiculous, and yet be truth.<br />
  Women are angels: just a little weak<br />
  And just a little wicked, it may be,<br />
  Yet still the sweetest beings in the world;<br />
  But when one stands with apprehensive gasp<br />
  At verge of sternutation, or leaps off,<br />
  Projecting all her being in a sneeze,<br />
  Or snores with lips wide-parted, or essays<br />
  The 'double-quick,' we turn our eyes away<br />
  In sadness, that a creature so divine<br />
  Can be so shockingly ridiculous;<br />
  Yet who shall say she's not an angel still?<br />
  Now you present to me the meanest face<br />
  Of a most noble truth.  I laugh with you<br />
  Over its sorry semblance; but the truth<br />
  Is still divine, and claims our reverence.<br />
  The great King Solomon&mdash;and you believe<br />
  In Solomon&mdash;has said that a good name<br />
  Is more to be desired than much fine gold.<br />
  If a good name be matter of desire<br />
  Beyond all wealth&mdash;and you will pardon me<br />
  For holding to the record&mdash;it may stand<br />
  As a grand motive in the life of man,<br />
  To grand endeavor.  I have yet to learn<br />
  That Solomon addressed his words to bears,<br />
  Or little children.  I am forced to think<br />
  That you and I, and all who read his words,<br />
  Are those for whom he wrote."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rejoining she:<br />
  "A good may be the subject of desire,<br />
  And not be motive to achievement.  Life,<br />
  If I may speak the riddle, is a scheme<br />
  Of indirections.  My own happiness<br />
  Is something to desire; and yet, I know<br />
  That I must win it by forgetting it<br />
  In ministry to others.  If I make<br />
  My happiness the motive of my work,<br />
  I spoil it by the taint of selfishness.<br />
  But are you sure that you do not presume<br />
  Somewhat too much, in claiming the desire<br />
  For a good name as motive of your life?<br />
  Greatness, not goodness, is the end you seek,<br />
  If I mistake you not; and these are held,<br />
  In the world's thought, as two, and most distinct.<br />
  King Solomon was wise, but wiser He<br />
  Who said to those who loved and followed him,<br />
  'Who would be great among you, let him serve.'<br />
  The greatest men and artists should be such,<br />
  For they are God's nobility and man's<br />
  Should work from greatest motives.  Selfishness<br />
  Is never great, and moves to no great deeds.<br />
  To honor God, to benefit mankind,<br />
  To serve with lofty gifts the lowly needs<br />
  Of the poor race for which the God-man died,<br />
  And do it all for love&mdash;oh! this is great!<br />
  And he who does this will achieve a name<br />
  Not only great but good."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not in this world,"<br />
  I answered her.  "I know too much of it.<br />
  The world is selfish; and it never gives<br />
  Due credit to a motive which assumes<br />
  To be above its own.  If a man write,<br />
  It takes for granted that he writes for fame,<br />
  And judges him accordingly.  It holds<br />
  Of no account all other aims and ends;<br />
  And visits with contempt the man who bears<br />
  A mission to his kind.  The critic pens<br />
  That twiddle with his work, or play with it<br />
  As cats with mice, are not remarkable<br />
  For gentle instincts; and my name must live<br />
  By pens like these.  I choose to take the world<br />
  Just as I find it, and I pitch my tune<br />
  To the world's key, that it may sing my tune.<br />
  And sing for me.  Ay, and I take myself<br />
  Just as I find myself.  I do not love<br />
  The human race enough to work for it.<br />
  Having no motive of philanthropy,<br />
  I'll make pretence to none.  The love of praise<br />
  I count legitimate and laudable.<br />
  'Tis not the noblest motive in the world,<br />
  But it is good; and it has won more fames<br />
  Than any other.  Surely, my good wife,<br />
  You would not shut me from it, and deprive<br />
  My power of its sole impulse."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No; oh! no,"<br />
  She answered quickly.  "I am only sad<br />
  That it should be the captain of your host.<br />
  All creatures of the brain are the result<br />
  Of many motives and of many powers.<br />
  All life is such, indeed.  The power that leads&mdash;<br />
  The motive dominant&mdash;this stamps the work<br />
  With its own likeness.  Throughout all the world<br />
  Are careful souls, with careful consciences,<br />
  That pierce themselves with questionings and fears<br />
  Because that, with the motives which are good,<br />
  And which alone they seek, a hundred come<br />
  They do not seek, and aye sophisticate<br />
  Their finest action.  They are wrong in this:<br />
  All motives bowing to one leadership,<br />
  And aiding its emprise, are one with it&mdash;<br />
  The same in trend, the same in terminus.<br />
  All the low motives that obey the law,<br />
  And aid the work, of one above them all,<br />
  Do holy service, and fulfil the end<br />
  For which they were designed.  The love of praise<br />
  Is not the lowest motive which can move<br />
  The human soul.  Nay, it may do good work<br />
  As a subordinate, and leave no soil<br />
  On whitest fabric, at whose selvage shines<br />
  The Master's broidered signature.  Although<br />
  You write for fame, think not you will escape<br />
  The press of other motives.  You love me;<br />
  You love your child; you love your pleasant home;<br />
  You love the memory of one long dead.<br />
  These, joined with all those qualities of heart<br />
  Which make you dear to me, will throng around<br />
  The leader you appoint, and come and go<br />
  Under his banner; and the work of God<br />
  Will thrive through these, the while your own goes on<br />
  God will not be defrauded, nor yet man;<br />
  And you, who like the Pharisees make prayer<br />
  At corners of the streets, for praise of men,<br />
  Will have reward you seek."<br />

  Responded I with laughter.  "Verily!<br />
  Though not a saint, I'll do a saintly work<br />
  For my own profit, and in spite of all<br />
  The selfishness that moves me.  Better, this,<br />
  Than I suspected.  My sweet casuist&mdash;<br />
  My gentle, learned, lovely casuist&mdash;<br />
  I thank you; and I'll pay you more than thanks.<br />
  I'll promise that when these fine motives come,<br />
  And volunteer their service, they shall find<br />
  Welcome and entertainment, and a place<br />
  Within the rank and file, with privilege<br />
  Of quick promotion, so they show themselves<br />
  Motives of mettle."<br />

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This the type of talk<br />
  That passed between us.  I was not a fool<br />
  To count her wisdom worthless; nor a God,<br />
  To work regeneration in myself.<br />
  That something which I longed for, to fill up<br />
  The measure of my good, was human praise;<br />
  Yet I could see that she was wholly right,<br />
  And that she held within herself resource<br />
  Of satisfaction better than my own.<br />
  But I was quite content&mdash;content to know<br />
  I trod the average altitude of those<br />
  Within the paths of art, and had no aims<br />
  To be misconstrued or misunderstood<br />
  By Pride and Selfishness&mdash;that these, in truth,<br />
  Expected of me what I had to give.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Strange, how a man may carry in his heart,<br />
  From year to year&mdash;through all his life, indeed&mdash;<br />
  A truth, or a conviction, which shall be<br />
  No more a part of it, and no more worth<br />
  Than to his flask the cork that slips within!<br />
  Of this he learns by sourness of his wine,<br />
  Of muddle of its color; by the bits<br />
  That vex his lips while drinking; but he feels<br />
  No impulse in his hand to draw it forth,<br />
  And bid it crown and keep the draught it spoils.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I write this, here, not for its relevance<br />
  To this one passage of my story, but<br />
  Because there slipped into my consciousness<br />
  Just at this juncture, and would not depart,<br />
  A truth I carried there for many years,<br />
  Each minute seeing, feeling, tasting it,<br />
  Yet never touching it with an attempt<br />
  To draw it forth, and put it to its place.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  One evening, when our usual theme was up,<br />
  I asked my wife in playful earnestness<br />
  How she became so wise.  "You talk," I said,<br />
  "Like one who has survived a thousand years,<br />
  And drunk the wisdom of a thousand lives."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Who lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God,<br />
  Who giveth freely and upbraideth not,"<br />
  Was her reply.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I never ask of God,"<br />
  I said.  "So, while you take at second hand<br />
  His breathings to the artist, I will take<br />
  At second hand the wisdom that he gives<br />
  To you his teacher."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you never pray?"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Never," I answered her.  "I cannot pray:<br />
  You know the reason.  Never since the day<br />
  God shut his heart against my mother's prayer<br />
  Have I raised one petition, or been moved<br />
  To reverence."<br />
</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her long, dark lashes fell,<br />
  And from her eyes there dropped two precious tears<br />
  That bathed her folded hands.  She pitied me,<br />
  With tenderness beyond the reach of words.<br />
  I did not seek her pity.  I was proud,<br />
  And asked her if she blamed me.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," she said;<br />
  "I have no right to blame you, and no wish.<br />
  I marvel only that a man like you<br />
  Can hold so long the errors of a boy.<br />
  I've looked&mdash;with how much longing, words of mine<br />
  Can never tell&mdash;for reason to restore<br />
  That priceless thing which passion stole from you,<br />
  And looked in vain."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Though piqued by the reproach<br />
  Her words conveyed (unwittingly I knew),<br />
  I wished to learn where, in her theory<br />
  Of human life, my case had found a place;<br />
  So, bidding pride aback, I questioned her.<br />
  "You are so wise in other things," I said,<br />
  "And read so well God's dealings with his own,<br />
  Perhaps you can explain this mystery<br />
  That clouds my life."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">

  She answered, "and, although my reason fail<br />
  To explicate the mystery that wraps<br />
  His providence, it does not shake my faith.<br />
  But this sad case of yours has seemed so plain,<br />
  That Reason well may spare the staff of Faith<br />
  To climb to its conclusions.  You are loved,<br />
  My husband: can you tell your wife for what?"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Oh! modesty! my dear; hem! modesty!<br />
  Spare me these blushes!  I have not at hand<br />
  The printed catalogue of qualities<br />
  Which give you inspiration, and decline<br />
  The personal rehearsal."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mistake,"<br />
  She answered, smiling.  "Not for modesty;<br />
  And as for blushes, they're not patent yet.<br />
  But frankly, soberly, I ask you this:<br />
  Have you a quality of heart or brain<br />
  Which makes you lovable, and in my eyes<br />
  A man to be admired, that was not born<br />
  Quick in your blood?  Pray, have you anything<br />
  Which you did not inherit?  Who to me<br />
  Furnished my husband?  By what happy law<br />
  Was all that was the finest, noblest, best<br />
  In those who gave you life, bestowed on you?<br />
  You have your father's form, your father's brain:<br />
  You have your mother's eyes, your mother's heart.<br />
  Those twain produced a man for me to love,<br />
  Out of themselves.  I am obliged to them<br />
  For the most precious good the round earth holds,<br />
  Transmitted by a law that slew them both.<br />
  It was not sin, or shame, for them to die<br />
  Just as they died.  They passed with whiter hands<br />
  Up to The Throne than he who wantonly<br />
  Murders a sparrow.  When your mother prayed<br />
  She prayed for the suspension of the law<br />
  By which from Eve, the mother of the race,<br />
  She had received the grace and loveliness<br />
  Which made her precious to your heart&mdash;the law<br />
  By which alone she could convey these gifts<br />
  To others of her blood.  Your daughter's face<br />
  Is beautiful, her soul is pure and sweet,<br />
  By largess of this law.  Could God subvert,<br />
  To meet her wish, though shaped in agony,<br />
  The law which, since the life of man began<br />
  In life of God, has kept the channel clear<br />
  For His own blood, that it might bless the last<br />
  Of all the generations as the first?<br />
  What could He more than give her liberty&mdash;<br />
  When reason lay in torture or in wreck,<br />
  And life was death&mdash;to part with stainless hand<br />
  The tie that held her from his loving breast?"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  If God himself had dropped her words from heaven.<br />
  They had not reached with surer plummet-plunge<br />
  The depths of my conviction.  I was dumb;<br />
  I opened not my mouth; but left her side,<br />
  And sought the crowded street.  I felt that all<br />
  Delusions, subterfuges, self-deceits,<br />
  By which my soul had shut itself from God,<br />
  Were stripped away, and that no barrier<br />
  Was interposed between us which was not<br />
  My own hand's building.  Never, nevermore,<br />
  Could I hold God in blame, or deem myself<br />
  A guiltless, injured creature.  I could see<br />
  That I was hard, implacable, unjust;<br />
  And that by force of wilful choice I held<br />
  Myself from God; for no impulsion came<br />
  To seek his face and favor.  Nay, I feared<br />
  And fought such incidence, as enemy<br />
  Of all my plans.<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it became thenceforth<br />
  A problem with me how to separate<br />
  My new conviction from my life&mdash;to hold<br />
  A revolutionizing truth within,<br />
  And hold it yet so loosely, it should be<br />
  Like a dumb alien in a mural town&mdash;<br />
  No guest, but an intruder, who might bide,<br />
  By law or grace, but win no domicile,<br />
  And hold no power.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">

  My course was chosen, with such sense of guilt<br />
  I blushed before the calm, inquiring eyes<br />
  That met me at my threshhold; but the theme<br />
  Was dropped just there.  My gentle mentor read<br />
  The secret of the struggle and the sin,<br />
  And left me to myself.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the set time,<br />
  I entered on my task.  The discipline<br />
  Of early years told feebly on my work,<br />
  For dissipation and disuse of power<br />
  Had brought me back to infancy again.<br />
  My will was weak, my patience was at fault,<br />
  And in my fretful helplessness, I stormed<br />
  And sighed by turns; yet still I held in force<br />
  Determination, as reserve of will;<br />
  And when I flinched or faltered, always fell<br />
  Back upon that, and saved my powers from rout.<br />
  Casting, recasting, till I found the germ<br />
  Of my conception putting forth its whorls<br />
  In orderly succession round the stem<br />
  Of my design, that straight and strong shot up<br />
  Toward inflorescence, my long work went on,<br />
  Till I was filled with satisfying joy.<br />
  This lasted for a little time, and then<br />
  There came reaction.  I grew tired of it.<br />
  My verses were as meaningless and stale<br />
  As doggrel of the stalls.  I marvelled much<br />
  That they could ever have beguiled my pride<br />
  Into self-gratulation, or done aught<br />
  But overwhelm me with contempt for them,<br />
  And the dull pen that wrote them.<br />
</p>

  To form and finish my projected work<br />
  Within, and by, myself,&mdash;to tease no ear<br />
  With fragmentary snatches of my song,<br />
  And call for no support from friendly praise<br />
  To reinforce my courage; but the stress<br />
  Of my disgust and my despair&mdash;the need,<br />
  Imperative and absolute, to brace myself<br />
  By some opinion borrowed for the nonce,<br />
  And bathe my spirit in the sympathy<br />
  Of some strong nature&mdash;mastered my intent,<br />
  And sent me for resource to her whose heart<br />
  Was ever open to my call.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat<br />
  Through the long hour in which I read to her,<br />
  Absorbed, entranced, as one who sits alone<br />
  Within a dim cathedral, and resigns<br />
  His spirit to the organ-theme, that mounts,<br />
  Or sinks in tremulous pauses, or sweeps out<br />
  On mighty pinions and with trumpet voice<br />
  Through labyrinthine harmonies, at last<br />
  Emerging, and through silver clouds of sound<br />
  Receding and receding, till it melts<br />
  In the abysses of the upper sky.<br />
  It was not needful she should say a word;<br />
  For in her glowing eyes and kindling face,<br />
  I caught the full assurance that my heart<br />
  Had yearned for; but she spoke her hearty praise<br />
  And when I asked her for her criticism,<br />
  Bestowed it with such modest deference<br />
  To my opinion, as to spare my pride;<br />
  Yet, with such subtle sense of harmony,<br />
  And insight of proportion, that I saw<br />
  That I should find no critic in the world<br />
  More competent or more severe.  I said,<br />
  Gulping my pride: "Better this ordeal<br />
  In friendly hands, before the time of types,<br />
  Than afterward, in hands of enemies!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So, from that reading, it was understood<br />
  Between us that, whenever I essayed<br />
  Revising and retouching, I should know<br />
  Her intimate impressions, and receive<br />
  Her frank suggestions.  In this oversight<br />
  And constant interest of one whose mind<br />
  Was excellent and pure, and raised above<br />
  All motive to beguile me, I secured<br />
  New inspiration.<br />

  With gradient hopefulness, and strength renewed<br />
  At each renewal of the confidence<br />
  I had reposed in her; till I perceived<br />
  That I was living on her praise&mdash;that she<br />
  Held God's place in me and the multitude's.<br />
  And now, as I look back upon those days<br />
  Of difficult endeavor, I confess<br />
  That had she not been with me, I had failed&mdash;<br />
  Ay, foundered in mid-sea&mdash;my hope, my life,<br />
  The spoil of deep oblivion.<br />

  "I cannot make it better," I exclaimed.<br />
  "I can write better, but, before I write,<br />
  I must have recognition in the voice<br />
  Of public praise.  A good paymaster pays<br />
  When work is finished.  Let him pay for this,<br />
  And I will work again; but, till he pay,<br />
  My leisure is my own, and I will wait."<br />

  "And if he grudge your wage?" suggested she<br />

<p class="poem">
  Came then the proofs and latest polishing<br />
  Of words and phrases&mdash;work I shared with her<br />
  To whom I owed so much; and then the fear,<br />
  The deathly heart-fall, and the haunting dread<br />
  That go before exposure to the world<br />
  Of inmost life, and utmost reach of power<br />
  Toward revelation;&mdash;then the shrinking spell,<br />
  When morbid love of self awaits in pain<br />
  The verdict it has courted.<br />

  The book was out.  My daughter's hand in mine&mdash;<br />
  Her careless feet, that thrilled with springing life,<br />
  Skipping the pavement&mdash;I walked down Broadway,<br />
  To ease the restlessness and cool the heat<br />
  That vexed my idle waiting.  As we passed<br />
  A showy window, filled with costly books,<br />
  My little girl exclaimed: "Oh, father!  See!<br />
  There is your name!"<br />

  Within my veins, at one wild heart-thump, dropped,<br />
  And I was limp as water; but I paused,<br />
  And read the placard.  It announced my book<br />
  In characters of flame, with adjectives<br />
  My daring publisher had filched, I think<br />
  From an old circus broadside.<br />

  Biting my lip&mdash;"I'm in the market now!<br />
  How much&mdash;O! rattling, roaring multitude!<br />
  O! selfish, cheating, lying multitude!<br />
  O! hawking, trading, delving multitude!&mdash;<br />
  How much for one man's hope, for one man's life?<br />
  What for his toil and pain?&mdash;his heart's red blood?<br />
  What for his brains and breeding?  Oh, how much<br />

  And bought my book&mdash;not doubting I was first<br />
  To give response to my apostrophe.<br />
  The smug old clerk, who found his length of ear<br />
  Convenient as a pencil-rack, and thus<br />
  Made nature's wrath proclaim the praise of trade,<br />
  Wrapped my dear bantling well; and, as he dropped<br />
  My dollar in his till, smiled languidly<br />
  Upon my little girl, and said to me&mdash;<br />
  To cheer me in my purchase&mdash;that the book<br />
  Was thought to be a deuced clever thing.<br />
  He never read such books; he had no time;<br />
  Indeed, he had no interest in them.<br />
  Still, other people had, and it was well,<br />
  For it helped trade along.<br />

  A vulgar fraction of the integral<br />
  We speak of as "the people," and "the world"&mdash;<br />
  I had been writing!  Had he read my book,<br />
  And given it his praise, I should have been<br />
  Delighted, though I knew that his applause<br />
  Was worthless as his brooch.  I was a fool<br />
  Undoubtedly; yet I could understand,<br />
  Better than e'er before, how separate<br />
  The artist is from such a soul as his&mdash;<br />
  What need of teachers and interpreters<br />
  To crumble in his pewter porringer<br />
  The rounded loaf, whose crust was adamant<br />

  Was purchased early, though I read in vain<br />
  To find my reputation.  But at night,<br />
  My door-bell rang; and I received a note<br />
  From one who edited an evening print,<br />
  (I had dined with him at my publisher's),<br />
  Inclosing a review, and venturing<br />
  The hope that I should like it.<br />

  He knew the tricks of trade, and was adroit.<br />
  My poem was "a revelation."  I had "burst<br />
  Like thunder from a calm and cloudless sky."<br />
  Well, not to quote his language, this the drift:<br />
  A man of fortune, living at his ease,<br />
  But fond of manly effort, had sat down,<br />
  And turned his culture to supreme account;<br />
  And he&mdash;the editor&mdash;took on himself<br />
  To thank him on the world's behalf.  Withal,<br />
  The poet had betrayed the continence<br />
  Of genius.  He had held, undoubtedly,<br />
  The consciousness of power from early youth;<br />
  But, yielding never to the itch for print,<br />
  Had nursed and chastened and developed it,<br />
  Until his hand was strong, and swept his lyre<br />

  Sage comments on the rathe and puny brood<br />
  Of poet-sucklings, who had rushed to type<br />
  Before their time&mdash;pale stems that spun their flowers<br />
  In the first sunshine, but, when Autumn came,<br />
  Were fruitless.  It was pleasant, too, to see,<br />
  In such an age of sentimental cant,<br />
  One man who dared to hold up to the world<br />
  A creature of his brain, and say: "Look you!<br />
  This is my thought; and it shall stand alone.<br />
  It has no moral, bears no ministry<br />
  Of pious teaching, and makes no appeal<br />
  To sufferance or suffrage of the muffs<br />
  Who, in the pulpit or the press, prepare<br />
  The nation's pap.  The fiery-footed barb<br />
  That pounds the pampas, and the lily-bells<br />
  That hang above the brooks, present the world<br />
  With no apology for being there,<br />
  And no attempt to justify themselves<br />
  In uselessness.  It is enough for God<br />
  That they are beautiful, and hold his thought<br />
  In fine embodiment; and it shall be<br />
  Enough for me that, in this book of mine,<br />
  I have created somewhat that is strong<br />
  And beautiful, which, if it profit,&mdash;well:<br />
  If not, 'tis no less strong and beautiful,<br />
  And holds its being by no feebler right."<br />

<p class="poem">
  Ay, it was glorious to find one man<br />
  Who piled no packs upon his Pegasus,<br />
  Nor chained him to a rag-cart, loaded down<br />
  With moral frippery, and strings of bells<br />
  To call the people to their windows.<br />

  There followed extracts, with a change of type<br />
  To mark the places where the editor<br />
  Had caught a fancy hiding, which he feared<br />
  Might slip detection under slower eyes<br />
  Than those he carried; or to emphasize<br />
  Felicities of diction that were stiff<br />
  In Roman verticals, but grew divine<br />
  At the Italic angle; then apology,<br />
  Profoundly humble, to his patrons all<br />
  For quoting at such length, and one to me<br />
  For quoting anything, and deep regrets,<br />
  In quite a general way, that lack of space<br />
  Forbade a reproduction of the book<br />

  I drank the whole, at one long, luscious draught;<br />
  Tipping the tankard high, that I might see<br />
  My features at the bottom, and regale<br />
  My pride, after my palate.  Then I tossed<br />
  The paper to my wife, and bade her read.<br />
  I watched her while she read, but failed to find<br />
  The sympathy of pleasure in her face<br />
  I had expected.  Finishing at last,<br />
  She raised her eyes, and, fixing them on me,<br />
  Said thoughtfully: "You like this, I suspect."<br />

<p class="poem">
  "Well, truly!" I responded, "since it seems<br />
  To be the first instalment of the wage<br />

  Ay, it is sweet to me.  I know it fails<br />
  In nice discrimination,&mdash;that it slurs<br />
  Defects which I perceive as well as you;<br />

  The 'manly effort,' for whose exercise<br />

  With fierce forestalment all the critic-quills<br />

  Your poem had no mission, save, perhaps,<br />
  The tickle of the taste, and that it bore<br />
  Upon its glowing gold small food for life.<br />
  He saw just there the point to be attacked;<br />
  And there threw up his earth-works, and spread out<br />
  His thorned abattis.  He was very kind<br />
  Undoubtedly, and very cunning, too;<br />
  For well he knew that there are earnest souls<br />
  In the broad world, who claim that highest art<br />
  Is highest ministry to human need;<br />
  And that the artist has no Christian right<br />
  To prostitute his art to selfish ends,<br />
  Or make it vehicle alone of plums<br />
  For the world's pudding."<br />

  Among the multitude, or by the guild<br />

  In influence; and these, my wife, are all<br />

  Their bitter enmity, I might receive<br />
  Such superflux of praise and patronage<br />
  As would o'erwhelm my sweetly Christian wife<br />
  With shame and misery.  But we shall see;<br />

  Exploded at the middle of the week;<br />
  At last, a hundred-pounder quarterly<br />
  Gave it a single missive from its mask<br />
  Of far and dark impersonality.<br />
  The smoke cleared up, and still my colors<br />
  And still my book stood proudly in the sun,<br />
  Nor breached nor battered.<br />

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had won a place<br />
  That I was sure of.  All had said of me<br />
  That I was "brilliant:" was not that enough?<br />
  The petty pesterers, with card and stamp,<br />
  Who hunt for autographs, were after me,<br />
  In packages by post; and idle men<br />
  Held me at corners by the button-hole,<br />
  And introduced me to their friends.  I dined<br />
  With meek-eyed men, whose literary wives<br />
  Were dying all to know me, as they said;<br />
  And the lyceums, quick at scent and sight&mdash;<br />
  Watching the jungles for a lion&mdash;all<br />
  Courted the delectation of my roar<br />
  Upon their platforms, pledging to my hand<br />
  (With city reference to stanchest names),<br />
  Such honoraria as would have been<br />
  The lion's share of profits.  These were straws;<br />
  But they had surer fingers for the wind<br />
  Than withes or weathercocks.<br />

  My publisher (who published at my risk,<br />
  And first put on the airs of one who stooped<br />
  To grant a favor), brimmed and overflowed<br />
  With courtesy; and ere a year was gone,<br />
  Became importunate for something more.<br />
  This was his plea: I owed it to myself<br />
  To write again.  The time to make one's hay<br />
  Is when the sun shines: time to write one's books<br />
  Is when the public humor turns to them.<br />
  The public would forget me in a year,<br />
  And seek another idol; or, meanwhile,<br />
  Another writer might usurp my throne,<br />
  And I be hooted from my own domain<br />
  As a pretender.  Then the market's maw<br />
  Was greedy for my poems.  Just how long<br />
  The appetite would last, he could not tell,<br />
  For appetite is subject of caprice,<br />
  And never lasts too long.<br />

  I plainly saw, and gave me the results<br />
  Of observation and experience.<br />
  I took his hint, accepting with a pang<br />
  The truths that came with it: for instance, these:&mdash;<br />
  That he who speaks for praise of those who live,<br />
  Must keep himself before his audience,<br />
  Nor look for "bravas," cheers, and cries of "hear!<br />
  And clap of hands and stamp of feet, except<br />
  With fresh occasion; that applause of crowds,<br />
  Though fierce, runs never to the chronic stage;<br />
  That good paymasters, having paid for work<br />
  The doer's price, expect receipt in full<br />
  At even date; and that if I would keep<br />
  My place, as grand purveyor to the greed<br />
  For novelties of literary art,<br />
  My viands must be sapid, and abound<br />
  With change, to wake or whet the appetite<br />
  I sought to feed.<br />

  Bestowed in selfishness, without a doubt,<br />
  Though in my interest.  For ten long years<br />
  It was the basis of my policy.<br />
  I poured my poems with redundancy<br />
  Upon the world, and won redundant meed.<br />
  If I gave much, the world was generous,<br />
  Repaying more than justice: but, at last,<br />
  Tired and disgusted, I laid down my pen.<br />
  I knew my work would not outlast my life,<br />
  That the enchantments which had wreathed themselves<br />
  Around my name were withering away,<br />
  With every breath of fragrance they exhaled;<br />
  And that, too soon, the active brain and hand<br />
  Whose skill had conjured them, would faint and fail<br />
  Under the press of weariness and years.<br />
  My reputation piqued me.  None believed<br />
  That it was in me to write otherwise<br />
  Than I had written.  All the world had laughed,<br />
  Or shaken its wise head, had I essayed<br />
  A work beyond the round of brilliancies<br />
  In which my pen had revelled, and for which<br />
  It gave such princely guerdon.  If I looked,<br />
  Or came to look, with measureless contempt<br />
  On those who gave with such munificence<br />
  The boon I sought, I had provoking cause.<br />
  I fooled them all with patent worthlessness,<br />
  And they insisted I should fool them still.<br />
  The wisdom of a whole decade had failed<br />
  To teach them that the thing my hand had done<br />
  Was not worth doing.<br />

  I found my character and self-respect<br />
  Eroded by the canker of conceit,<br />
  Poisoned by jealousy, and made the prey<br />
  Of meanest passions.  Harlequins in mask,<br />
  Who live upon the laughter of the throng<br />
  That crowds their reeking amphitheatres;<br />
  Light-footed dancing-girls, who sell their grace<br />
  To gaping lechers of the pit, to win<br />
  That which shall feed their shameless vanity;<br />
  The mimics of the buskin&mdash;baser still,<br />
  The mimics of the negro&mdash;minstrel-bands.<br />
  With capital of corks and castanets<br />
  And threadbare jests&mdash;Ah! who and what was I<br />
  But brother of all these&mdash;in higher walk,<br />
  But brother in the motive of my life,<br />
  In jealousy, in recompense for toil,<br />

  Stray silver in her hair in these long years;<br />
  And the sweet maiden springing from our lives<br />
  Had grown to womanhood.  In my pursuits,<br />
  Which drank my time and my vitality,<br />
  I had neglected them.  I worked at home,<br />
  But lived in other scenes, for other lives,<br />
  Or, rather, for my own; and though my pride<br />
  Shrank from the deed, I had the tardy grace<br />
  To call them to me, and confess my shame,<br />

  All explanations passed&mdash;I sat beside<br />
  My faithful wife, and canvassed as of old<br />
  New plans of life.  I found her still the same<br />
  In purpose and in magnanimity;<br />
  For she dealt no upbraidings and no blame;<br />
  Cast in my teeth no old-time prophecies<br />
  Of failure; felt no triumph which rejoiced<br />
  To mock me with the words, "I told you so,"<br />
  Calmly she sat, and tried, with gentlest speech,<br />
  To heal the bruises of my fall; to wake<br />
  A better feeling in me toward the world,<br />

  According to his choice.  I had essayed<br />
  To please the world, and gather in its praise;<br />
  And, certainly, the world was pleased with me,<br />
  And had not stinted me in its return<br />

  But there was much in them that yielded strength<br />
  To struggling souls, and, to the wounded, balm.<br />
  Indeed, she had been helped by them, herself.<br />
  They were all pure; they made no foul appeal<br />
  To baseness and brutality; they had<br />
  An element of gentle chivalry,<br />
  Such as must have a place in any man<br />
  Shrinking with sensitiveness, like myself,<br />

  I have not dared to speak the royal truth<br />
  For fear of censure; I have been a slave<br />

  That which was highest, grandest in my art<br />
  I have not reached, and have not tried to reach<br />
  I have but touched the surfaces of things<br />

  "Suppose," she said, "that all the artist-souls<br />
  That God has made since time and art began<br />
  Had acted on your theory: suppose<br />
  In architecture, picture, poetry,<br />
  Naught had found utterance but works that sprang<br />
  To satisfy the worker, and reveal<br />
  That bundle of ideas which, to him,<br />
  Is constituted art; but which, in truth,<br />
  Is figment of his fancy, or his thought,&mdash;<br />
  His creature, made his God&mdash;say where were all<br />
  The temples, palaces and homes of men;<br />
  The galleries that blaze with history,<br />
  Or bloom with landscape, or look down<br />
  With smile of changeless love or loveliness<br />
  Into the hearts of men?  And where were all<br />
  The poems that give measure to their praise,<br />
  Voice to their aspirations, forms of light<br />
  To homely facts and features of their life,<br />
  Enveloping this plain, prosaic world<br />
  In an ideal atmosphere, in which<br />
  Fair angels come and go?  All gifts of men<br />
  Were made for use, and made for highest use,<br />
  If highest use be service of one's self,<br />
  And highest standard, one's embodiment<br />
  Of dogmas, theories and thoughts of art,<br />
  As art's identity, then are you right;<br />
  But if a higher use of gift and art<br />
  Be service of mankind, and higher rule<br />

  "But art?"&mdash;responded I&mdash;"you do not mean<br />
  That art is nothing but a thing of thought,<br />

  That it is somewhat&mdash;a grand entity&mdash;<br />
  An organism of lofty principles,<br />
  Informed with subtlest life, and clothed upon<br />
  With usage and tradition of the men<br />
  Who, working in those sunny provinces<br />
  Where it holds eminent domain, have brought<br />
  To build its temple and adorn its walls<br />
  The usufruct of countless lives.  So far<br />
  Is art from being creature of man's thought<br />
  That it is subject of his knowledge&mdash;stands<br />
  In mighty mystery, and challenges<br />
  The study of the world; rules noblest minds<br />
  Like law or like religion; is a power<br />
  To which the proudest artist-spirits bow<br />
  With humblest homage.  Is astronomy<br />
  The creature of man's thought?  Is chemistry?<br />
  Yet these hold not, in this our universe,<br />
  A form more definite, nor yet a place<br />
  In human knowledge more beyond dispute,<br />
  Than art itself.  To this embodiment<br />
  Of theory&mdash;of dogmas, if you will&mdash;<br />
  This body aggregate of truth revealed<br />
  In growing light of ages to the eyes<br />
  Touched to perception, I devote my life."<br />

  "Nay, you're too fast," she said: "let alchemy<br />
  And old astrology present your thought.<br />
  These were somewhat; these were grand entities;<br />
  But they went out like candles in thin air<br />
  When knowledge came.  The sciences are things<br />
  Of law, of force, relations, measurements,<br />
  Affinities and combinations, all<br />
  The definite, demonstrable effects<br />
  Of first and second causes.  Between these<br />
  And men's opinions, braced by usages,<br />
  The space is wide.  The thing which you call art<br />
  Is anything but definite in form,<br />
  Or fixed in law.  It has as many shapes<br />
  As worshippers.  The world has many books,<br />
  Written by earnest men, about this art;<br />
  But having read them, we are no more wise<br />
  Than he whose observation of the sun<br />
  Is taken by kaleidoscope.  The more<br />
  He sees in it, the more he is confused.<br />
  The sun works, doubtless, many fine effects<br />
  With what he sees, but he sees not the sun."<br />

  Then she: "Yes, politics has history,<br />
  And therefore has a being,&mdash;has, in truth,<br />
  Just such a being as I grant to art&mdash;<br />
  A being of opinions.  Every state<br />
  Has origin and ends of government<br />
  Peculiarly its own, and so, from these,<br />
  Constructs its theory of politics,<br />
  And holds this theory against the world;<br />
  And holds it well.  There is no fixedness<br />
  Or form of politics for all mankind;<br />
  And there is none of art.  Each artist-soul<br />
  Is its own law; and he who dares to bring<br />
  From work of other man, to lay on yours,<br />
  His square and compass&mdash;thus declaring him<br />
  The pattern man&mdash;and tells, by him, you lack<br />
  Just so much here, or wander so much there,<br />
  Thereby confesses just how much he lacks<br />
  Of wisdom and plain sense.  For every man<br />
  Has special gift of power and end of life.<br />
  No man is great who lives by other law<br />
  Than that which wrapped his genius at his birth.<br />
  The Lind is great because she is the Lind,<br />
  And not the Malibran.  Recorded art<br />
  Is yours to study&mdash;e'en to imitate,<br />
  In education&mdash;imitate or shun,<br />
  As the case warrants; but it has destroyed,<br />
  Or toned to commonplace, more gifts of God<br />
  Than it has ever fanned to life or fed.<br />
  Who never walks save where he sees men's tracks<br />
  Makes no discoveries.  Show me the man<br />
  Who, leaving God and nature and himself,<br />
  Sits at the feet of masters, stuffs his brain<br />
  With maxims, notions, usages and rules,<br />
  And yields his fancy up to leading-strings,<br />
  And I shall see a man who never did<br />
  A deed worth doing.  So, in the name of art&mdash;<br />
  Nay, in the name of God&mdash;do no such thing<br />
  As smutch your knees by bowing at a shrine,<br />
  Whose doubtful deity, in midst of dust,<br />
  Sits in the cast-off robes of devotees,<br />
  And lives on broken victuals!"<br />

  To tell exactly what we understand<br />
  By the hack term&mdash;suppose we take the word,<br />
  And try to find its meaning.  You recall<br />
  Old John who dressed the borders in our court:<br />
  You called him, hired him, told him what to do.<br />
  He and his rake stood interposed between<br />
  You and your work.  You chose his skilful hands,<br />
  Endowing them with pay, or pledge of pay,<br />
  And set him at his labor.  Now suppose<br />
  Old John had had a philosophic turn<br />
  After you left him, and had thought like this:<br />
  'I am called here to do a certain work&mdash;<br />
  My rake tells what; and he who called me here<br />
  Has given me the motive for the job.<br />
  The work is plain.  These borders are to be<br />
  Levelled and cleaned of weeds: my hand and rake<br />
  Are fitted for the service;&mdash;this my art;<br />
  And it is first of all the arts.  There's none<br />
  More ancient, useful, worshipful, indeed,<br />
  Than agriculture.  Adam practised it;<br />
  Poets have sung its praises; and the great<br />
  Of every age have loved and honored it.<br />
  This art is greater than the man I serve,<br />
  And greater than his borders.  Therefore I<br />
  Will serve my art, and let the borders lie,<br />
  And my employer whistle.  True to that,<br />
  And to myself, it matters not to me<br />
  What weeds may grow, or what the master think<br />
  Of my proceeding!'<br />

  He hangs his rake upon your garden wall,<br />
  And steals your clematis, with which to wind<br />
  The handle upward; then o'erfills his hands<br />
  With roses and geraniums, and weaves<br />
  Their beauty into laurel, for a crown<br />
  For his slim god, completing his devoir<br />
  By buttering the teeth, and kneeling down<br />
  In abject homage.  Pray, what would you say,<br />
  At close of day, when you should go to see<br />
  Your untouched borders, and your gardener<br />
  At genuflexion, with your mignonette<br />
  In every button-hole?  Remember, now,<br />
  He has been true to art and to himself,<br />
  According to his notion; nor forget<br />
  To take along a dollar for his hire,<br />
  Which he expects, of course!  What would you say?"<br />

<p class="poem">
  "Oh, don't mind that: you've reached your 'fifthly' now,<br />
  And here the 'application' comes," I said.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I think," responded she, with an arch smile,<br />
  "The application's needless: but you men<br />
  Are so obtuse, when will is in the way,<br />
  That I will do your bidding.  Every gift<br />
  That God bestows on men holds in itself<br />
  The secret of its office, like the rake<br />
  The gardener wields.  The rake was made to till&mdash;<br />
  Was fashioned, head and handle, for just that;<br />
  And if, by grace of God, you hold a gift<br />
  So fashioned and adapted, that it stands<br />
  In like relation of supremest use<br />
  To life of men, the office of your gift<br />
  Has perfect definition.  Gift like this<br />
  Is yours, my husband.  In your facile hands<br />
  God placed it for the service of himself,<br />
  In service of your kind.  Taking this gift,<br />
  And using it for God and for the world,<br />
  In your own way, and in your own best way;<br />
  Seeking for light and knowledge everywhere<br />
  To guide your careful hand; and opening wide<br />
  To spiritual influx all your soul,<br />
  That so your master may breathe into you,<br />
  And breathe his great life through you, in such forms<br />
  Of pure presentment as he gives you skill<br />
  To build withal&mdash;that's all of art&mdash;for you.<br />
  Art is an instrument, and not an end&mdash;<br />
  A servant, not a master, nor a God<br />
  To be bowed down to.  Shall we worship rakes?<br />
  Honor of art, by him whose work is art,<br />
  Is a fine passion; but he honors most<br />
  Whose use and end are best."<br />

Use!  Use!"<br />
  I cried impatiently;&mdash;"nothing but use!<br />
  As if God never made a violet,<br />
  Or hung a harebell, or in kindling gold<br />
  Garnished a sunset, or upreared the arch<br />
  Of a bright rainbow, or endowed a world&mdash;<br />
  A universe, indeed&mdash;stars, firmament,<br />
  The vastitudes of forest and of sea,<br />
  Swift brooks and sweeping rivers, virid meads<br />
  And fluff of breezy hills&mdash;with tints that range<br />
  The scale of spectral beauty, till they leave<br />
  No glint or glory of the changeful light<br />
  Without a revelation!  Is this use&mdash;<br />
  I beg your pardon, love: you say 'this art'&mdash;<br />
  The sum and end of art?  If it be so,<br />
  Then God's no artist.  Are the crystal brooks<br />
  Sweeter for singing to the thirsty brutes<br />
  That dip their beaded muzzles in the foam?<br />
  Burns the tree better that its leaves are green?<br />
  Sleeps the sun sounder under canopy<br />
  Of gold or rose?"<br />

  Responded she.  "Whatever elevates<br />
  Inspires, refreshes, any human soul,<br />
  Is useful to that soul.  Beauty has use<br />
  For you and me.  The dainty violet<br />
  Blooms in our thought, and sheds its fragrance there<br />
  And we are gainers through its ministry.<br />
  All God's great values wear the drapery<br />
  That most becomes them.  Beauty may, in truth,<br />
  Be incident of art and not be end&mdash;<br />
  Its form, condition, features, dress, and still<br />
  The humblest value of the things of art.<br />
  This truth obtains in all God's artistry.<br />
  Does God make beauty for himself, alone?<br />
  He is, and holds, all beauty.  Has he need<br />
  To kindle rushes that he may behold<br />
  The glory of his thoughts? or need to use<br />
  His thoughts as plasms for the amorphous clay<br />
  That he may study models?  For an end<br />
  Outside himself, he ever speaks himself;<br />
  And end, with him, is use."<br />

  There's truth in what you utter," I replied;&mdash;<br />
  "A modicum of truth, at least; and still<br />
  There's something more which this our subtle talk<br />
  Has failed to give us.  I will not affirm<br />
  That art, recorded in its thousand forms,<br />
  And clothed with usages, traditions, rules,&mdash;<br />
  The thing of history&mdash;the mighty pile<br />
  Of drift that sweep of ages has brought down<br />
  To heap the puzzled present&mdash;is the sum<br />
  And substance of all art.  I will not claim&mdash;<br />
  Nay, mark me now&mdash;I will not even claim<br />
  That beauty is art's end, or has its end<br />
  Within itself.  Our tedious colloquy<br />
  Has cleared away the rubbish from my thought,<br />
  And given me cleaner vision.  I can see<br />
  Before, around me, underneath, above,<br />
  The great unrealized; and while I bow<br />
  To the traditions and the things of art,<br />
  And hold my theories, I find myself<br />
  Inspired supremely by the Possible<br />
  That calls for revelation&mdash;by the forms<br />
  That sleep imprisoned in the snowy arms<br />
  Of still unquarried truth, or stretch their hands<br />
  At sound of sledge and drill and booming fire,<br />
  Imploring for release.  I turn from men,<br />
  And stretch my hands toward these.  I feel&mdash;I know&mdash;<br />
  That there are mighty myriads waiting there,<br />
  And listening for my steps.  Suppose my age<br />
  Should fail to give them welcome: ay, suppose<br />
  They may not help a man to coin a dime<br />
  Or cook a dinner: they will fare as well<br />
  As much of God's truth fares, though clothed in forms<br />
  Divinely chosen.  Does God ever stint<br />
  His utterance because no creature hears?<br />
  Is it a grand and goodly thing, to spend<br />
  Brave life and precious treasure in a search<br />
  For palpitating water at the pole,<br />
  That so the sum of knowledge may be swelled,<br />
  Though pearls are not increased; and something less<br />
  To probe the Possible in art, or sit<br />
  Through months of dreary dark to catch a glimpse<br />
  Of the live truth that quivers with the jar<br />
  Of movement at its axle?  Is it good<br />
  To garner gain beyond the present need,<br />
  Won by excursive commerce in all seas;<br />
  And something less to pile redundantly<br />
  The spoil of thought?"<br />

  She answered musingly, "impress me much;<br />
  And yet, I think I see where they will lead,<br />
  Or, rather, fail to lead.  Your fantasy<br />
  Is beautiful but vague.  The Possible<br />
  Is a vast ocean, from which one poor soul,<br />
  With its slight oars, can float but flimsy freight;<br />
  Yet I would help your courage, for I see<br />
  Where your sole motive lies.  Go on, and prove<br />
  Whether your scheme or mine holds more of good;<br />
  And take my blessing with you."<br />

  And kissed my forehead.  Looking in her face,<br />
  By the sharp light that touched her, I was thrilled<br />
  By her flushed cheeks and strangely lustrous eyes.<br />
  She spoke not; but I heard the sigh she breathed&mdash;<br />
  The long-drawn, weary sigh&mdash;as she retired;<br />
  And then the Possible, which had inspired<br />
  So wondrously my hope, drooped low around,<br />
  And filled me with foreboding.<br />

  Been chilled by my neglect?  Was it on wane?<br />
  Could she be lost to me?  Oh! then I felt,<br />
  As I had never felt before, how mean<br />
  Beside one true affection is the best<br />
  Of all earth's prizes, and how little worth<br />
  The world would be without her love&mdash;herself!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But sleep refreshed her, and next morn she sat<br />
  At our bright board, in her accustomed place;<br />
  And sunlight was not sweeter than her smile,<br />
  Or cheerfuller.  My quick fears died away;<br />
  And though I saw that she had lost the fire<br />
  Of her young life, I comforted myself<br />
  With thinking that it was the same with me&mdash;<br />
  The sure result of years.<br />

  To my new passion, rioting at large<br />
  In the fresh realm of fancy and of thought<br />
  To which the passion bore me, and from which<br />
  I strove to gather for embodiment<br />
  Material of art.<br />

  The broader grew my dream.  The further on<br />

  Till, half in terror, half in reverence,<br />
  I learned that I had broached the Infinite!<br />
  I had not thought my Possible could bear<br />
  Such name as this, or wear such attribute;<br />
  And shrank befitting distance from the front<br />
  Of awful secrets, hid in awful flame,<br />
  That scorched and scared me.<br />

  And less adventurous, I chose, at last,<br />
  My theme and vehicle of song, and wrote.<br />
  My faculties, grown strong and keen by use,<br />
  Bent to their task with earnest faithfulness,<br />
  And glowed with high endeavor.  All of power<br />
  I had within me flowed into my hand;<br />
  And learning, language&mdash;all my life's resource&mdash;<br />
  Lay close around my enterprise, and poured<br />
  Their hoarded wealth of imagery and words<br />
  Faster than I could use it.  For long weeks,<br />
  My ardent labor crowded all my days,<br />
  Invaded sleep, and haunted e'en my dreams:<br />
  And then the work was done.<br />

  And sought for recreative rest in scenes<br />
  That once had charmed me&mdash;in society<br />
  Where I was welcome: but the common talk<br />
  Of daily news&mdash;of politics and trade&mdash;<br />
  Was senseless as the chatter of the jays<br />
  In autumn forests.  No refreshing balm<br />
  Came to me in the sympathy of men.<br />
  In my retirement, I had left the world<br />
  To go its way; and it had gone its way,<br />
  And left me hopelessly.<br />

  Of my dissatisfaction and disgust,<br />
  But found small comfort in her words.  She said:<br />
  "The world is wide, and woman's vision short;<br />
  But I have never seen a man who turned<br />
  His efforts from his kind, and failed to spoil<br />
  All men for him&mdash;himself, indeed, for them;<br />
  And he who gives nor sympathy nor aid<br />
  To the poor race from which he seeks such boon<br />
  Must be rejoiced if it be generous;<br />
  Content, if it be just.  Society<br />
  Is a grand scheme of service and return.<br />
  We give and take; and he who gives the most,<br />
  In ways directest, wins the best reward."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  By purpose, I closed eyes upon my work<br />
  For many weeks, resisting every day<br />
  The impulse to review the glowing dream<br />
  My fancy had engendered: for I wished<br />
  To go with faculty and fancy cooled<br />
  To its perusal.  I had strong desire,<br />
  So far as in me lay, to see the work<br />
  With the world's eyes, for reasons&mdash;ah!  I shrink<br />
  From writing them!  All men are sometimes weak,<br />
  And some are inconsistent with their wills.<br />
  If I were one of these, think not I failed<br />
  To justify my weakness to myself,<br />
  In ways that saved my pride.<br />

  I had an honest wish to learn how far<br />
  My work of heat had power to re-inspire<br />
  The soul that wrought it, and how well my verse<br />
  Had clothed and kept the creature of my thought;<br />
  For memory still retained the loveliness<br />

  Rest and diversion had performed their work,<br />
  And the long fever of my brain was gone,<br />
  I broached my feast, first making fast my door.<br />
  That so no eye should mark my greedy joy<br />
  Or my grimaces,&mdash;doubtful of the fate<br />
  That waited expectation.<br />

  To try, in these tame words, to paint the pang,<br />
  The faintness and the chill, which overwhelmed<br />
  My disappointed heart.  My welded thoughts<br />
  Which, in their whitest heat, had bent and bound<br />
  My language to themselves, imparting grace<br />
  To stiffest words, and meanings fresh and fine<br />
  To simplest phrases, interfusing all<br />
  With their own ardency, and shining through<br />
  With smoothly rounded beauty, lay in heaps<br />
  Of cold, unmeaning ugliness.  My words<br />
  Had shrunk to old proportions, and stood out<br />
  In hard, stiff angles, challenging a guess<br />
  Of what they covered.<br />

  Who knew the meaning that had once informed<br />
  Its faithless numbers, what way could I hope<br />
  That, to my own, or any future age,<br />
  My work should speak its full significance?<br />
  My latest child, begot in manly joy,<br />
  Conceived in purity, and born in toil,<br />
  Lay dead before me,&mdash;dead, and in the shroud<br />
  My hopeful hands had woven and bedecked<br />
  To be its chrisom.<br />

  The range of human commerce, save by force,<br />
  It never moves, nor lingers in the realm<br />
  It thus invades, a moment, if the voice<br />
  Of human commerce speak not the demand;&mdash;<br />
  That language is a thing of use;&mdash;that thought<br />

  Her bed!  The sweet, the precious nuptial bed!<br />
  Bed sanctified by love!  Bed blest of God<br />
  With fruit immortal!  Bed too soon to be<br />
  Crowned with the glory of a Christian death!<br />

  With tears and kisses.  In her gentle breast&mdash;<br />
  True home of love, and love and home to me&mdash;<br />
  The blood had burst its walls, and flowed in flame<br />
  From lips it left in ashes.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her smile<br />
  Of perfect trustfulness, I caught first glimpse<br />
  Of that aureola of fadeless light<br />
  Which spans my lonely couch, and kindles hope<br />
  That when my time shall come to follow her,<br />
  My spirit may go out, enwreathed and wrapped<br />
  By the familiar glory, which to-night<br />
  Shall brood o'er all my vigils and my dreams!<br />

<h3>
  DESPAIR.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Ah! what is so dead as a perished delight!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a passion outlived! or a scheme overthrown!<br />
  Save the bankrupt heart it has left in its flight,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still as quick as the eye, but as cold as a stone!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The honey-bee hoards for its winter-long need,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treasure it gathers in joy from the flowers;<br />
  And drinks in each sip of its silvery mead<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flavor and flush of the sweet summer hours.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But a pleasure expires at its earliest breath:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No labor can hoard it, no cunning can save;<br />
  For the song of its life is the sigh of its death,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sense it has thrilled is its shroud and its grave.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ah! what is our love, with its tincture of lust,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its pleasure that pains us and pain that endears,<br />
  But joy in an armful of beautiful dust<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That crumbles, and flies on the wings of the years?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And what is ambition for glory and power,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But desire to be reckoned the uppermost fool<br />
  Of a million of fools, for a pitiful hour,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And be cursed for a tyrant, or kicked for a tool?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Nay, what is the noblest that art can achieve,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to conjure a vision of light to the eyes,<br />
  That will pale ere we paint it, and pall ere we leave<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the heart it betrays and the hand it defies?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We love, and we long with an infinite greed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a love that will fill our deep longing, in vain;<br />
  The cup that we drink of is pleasant, indeed,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet it holds but a drop of the heavenly rain.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We plan for our powers the divinest we can;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do with our powers the supremest we may;<br />
  And, winning or losing, for labor and plan<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best that we garner is&mdash;rest and decay!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Content&mdash;satisfaction&mdash;who wins them?  Look down!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are held without thought by the dolts and the drones:<br />
  'Tis the slave who in carelessness carries the crown;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the hovels have kinglier men than the thrones.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The maid sings of love to the hum of her wheel;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her lover responds as he follows his team;<br />
  They wed, and their children come quickly to seal<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fulfilment the pledge of their loftiest dream.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  With humblest ambitions and homeliest fare,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contented, though toiling, they travel abreast,<br />
  Till the kind hand of death lifts their burden of care,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they sink, in the faith of their fathers, to rest.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Did I beg to be born?  Did I seek to exist?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did I bargain for promptings to loftier gains?<br />
  Did I ask for a brain, with contempt of the fist<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That could win a reward for its labor and pains?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Was it kind&mdash;the strong promise that girded my youth?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it good&mdash;the endowment of motive and skill?<br />
  Was it well to succeed, when success was, in truth,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the saddest of failure?  Make answer, who will!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Do I rave without reason?  Why, look you, I pray!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have won all I sought of the highest and best;<br />
  But it brings me no guerdon; and hopeless, to-day,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am poorer than when I set out on the quest.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Oh! emptiness!  Life, what art thou but a lie,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which I greeted and honored with hopefullest trust?<br />
  Bah! the beautiful apples that tempted my eye<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Break dead on my tongue into ashes and dust!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "A Father who loves all the children of men"?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A future to fill all these bottomless gaps"?<br />
  But one life has failed: can I fasten again<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my faith and my hope to a specious Perhaps!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O! man who begot me!  O! woman who bore!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, why did you call me to being and breath?<br />
  With ruin behind me, and darkness before,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have nothing to long for, or live for, but death!<br />

  PART IV.

<h3>
  CONSUMMATION.<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  A guest was in my house&mdash;a guest unbid&mdash;<br />
  Who stayed without a welcome from his host,&mdash;<br />
  So loathed and hated, on such errand bent,<br />
  And armed with such resistless power of ill,<br />
  I dared not look him in the face.  I heard<br />
  His tireless footsteps in the lonely halls,<br />
  In the chill hours of night; and, in the day,<br />
  They climbed the stairs, or loitered through the rooms<br />
  With lawless freedom.  Ever when I turned<br />
  I caught a glimpse of him.  His shadow stalked<br />
  Between me and the light, and fled before<br />
  My restless feet, or followed close behind.<br />
  Whene'er I bent above the couch that held<br />
  My fading wife, though looking not, I knew<br />
  That he was bending from the other side,<br />
  And mocking me.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Familiar grown, at last,<br />
  He came more closely&mdash;came and sat with me<br />
  Through hours of revery; or, as I paced<br />
  My dimly-lighted room, slipped his lank arm<br />
  Through mine, and whispered in my shrinking ear<br />
  Such fearful words as made me sick and cold.<br />
  He took the vacant station at my board,<br />
  Sitting where she had sat, and mixed my cup<br />
  With poisoned waters, saying in low tones<br />
  That none but I could hear:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This little room,<br />
  Where you have breakfasted and dined and supped,<br />
  And laughed and chatted in the days gone by,<br />
  Will be a lonely place when we are gone.<br />
  Those roses at the window, that were wont<br />
  To bloom so freely with the lady's care,<br />
  Already miss her touch.  That ivy-vine<br />
  Has grown a yard since it was tied, and needs<br />
  A training hand."<br />

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rising with bitter tears<br />
  To flee his presence, he arose with me,<br />
  And wandered through the rooms.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This casket here"&mdash;<br />
  I heard him say: "Suppose we loose the clasp.<br />
  These are her jewels&mdash;pretty gifts of yours.<br />
  There is a diamond: there a string of pearls.<br />
  That paly opal holds a mellowed fire<br />
  Which minds me of the mistress, whose bright soul,<br />
  Glows through the lucent whiteness of her face<br />
  With lambent flicker.  These are legacies:<br />
  She will not wear them more.  Her taste and mine<br />
  Are one in this, that both of us love flowers.<br />
  Ay, she shall have them, too, some pleasant day,<br />
  When she goes forth with me!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So? what is this?<br />
  Her wardrobe!  Let the door be opened wide!<br />
  This musk, so blent with scent of violets,<br />
  Revives one.  You remember when she wore<br />
  That lavender?&mdash;a very pretty silk!<br />
  Here is a <i>moire antique</i>.  Ah! yes&mdash;I see!<br />
  You did not like her in it.  'Twas too old,<br />
  And too suggestive of the dowager.<br />
  There is your favorite&mdash;that glossy blue&mdash;<br />
  The sweet tint stolen from the skies of June&mdash;<br />
  But she is done with it.  I wonder who<br />
  Will wear it, when your grief shall find a pause!<br />
  Your daughter&mdash;possibly? ... You shiver, sir!<br />
  Is it the velvet?  Like a pall, you think!<br />
  Well, close the door!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those slippers on the rug:<br />
  The time will come when you will kiss their soles<br />
  For the dear life that pressed them.  Their rosettes<br />
  Will be more redolent than roses then.<br />
  You did not know how much you loved your wife?<br />
  I thought so!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way!  Let us take our stand<br />
  Beside her bed.  Not quite so beautiful<br />
  To your fond eyes as when she was a bride,<br />
  Though still a lovely woman!  Seems it strange<br />
  That she is yours no longer?&mdash;that her hand<br />
  Is given to another&mdash;to the one<br />
  For whom she has been waiting all her life,<br />
  And ready all her life?  Your power is gone<br />
  To punish rivals.  There you stand and weep,<br />
  But dare not lift a finger, while with smiles<br />
  And kindly welcome she extends her hands<br />
  To greet her long-expected friend.  She knows<br />
  Where I will take her&mdash;to what city of God,<br />
  What palace there, and what companionship.<br />
  She knows what robes will drape her loveliness,<br />
  What flowers bedeck her hair, and rise and fall<br />
  Upon the pulses of her happy breast.<br />
  And you, poor man! with all your jealous pride,<br />
  Have learned that she would turn again to you,<br />
  And to your food and furniture of life,<br />
  With disappointment.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ay, she pities you&mdash;<br />
  Loves you, indeed; but there is One she loves<br />
  With holier passion, and with more entire<br />
  And gladder self-surrender.  She will go&mdash;<br />
  You know that she will go&mdash;and go with joy;<br />
  And you begin to see how poor and mean,<br />
  When placed beside her joy, are all your gifts,<br />
  And all that you have won by them.<br />
</p>

  Weeping again!  Well, if it comfort you,<br />
  Rain your salt tears upon her waxen hands,<br />
  And kiss them dry at leisure!  Press her lips,<br />
  Hot with the hectic!  Lay your cold, wet cheek<br />
  Against the burning scarlet of her own:<br />
  Only remember that she is not yours,<br />
  And that your paroxysms of grief and tears<br />
  Are painful to her."<br />

  To see one's idol with the signature<br />
  Of the Destroyer stamped upon her brow.<br />
  And know that she is doomed, beyond all hope;<br />
  To watch her while she fades; to see the form<br />
  That once was Beauty's own become a corpse<br />
  In all but breathing, and to meet her eyes<br />
  A hundred times a day&mdash;while the heart bleeds&mdash;<br />
  With smiles of smooth dissembling, and with words<br />
  Cheerful as morning, and to do all this<br />
  Through weeks and weary months, till one half longs<br />
  To see the spell dissolved, and feel the worst<br />
  That death can do: can there be misery<br />
  Sadder than this?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My time I passed alone,<br />
  And at the bedside of my dying wife.<br />
  She talked of death as children talk of sleep,<br />
  When&mdash;a forgetful blank&mdash;it lies between<br />
  Their glad impatience and a holiday.<br />
  The morrow&mdash;ah! the morrow!  That was name<br />
  For hope all realized, for work all done,<br />
  For pain all passed, for life and strength renewed.<br />
  For fruitage of endeavor, for repose,<br />
  For heaven!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would the morrow bring to me?<br />
  The morrow&mdash;ah! the morrow!  It was blank&mdash;<br />
  Nay, blank and black with gloom of clouds and night<br />
  Never before had I so realized<br />
  My helplessness.  I could not find relief<br />
  In love or labor.  I could only sit,<br />
  And gaze against a wall, without the power<br />
  To pierce or climb.  My pride of life was gone.<br />
  My spirit broken, and my strife with God<br />
  Was finished.  If I could not look before,<br />
  I dare not look above; and so, whene'er<br />
  I could forget the present, I went back<br />
  Upon the past.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One soft June day, my thoughts,<br />
  Touched by some song of bird, or glimpse of green,<br />
  Returned to life's bright morning, and the Junes<br />
  That flooded with their wealth of life and song<br />
  The valley of my birth.  Again I walked the meads,<br />
  Brilliant with beaded grass, and heard the shrill,<br />
  Sweet jargon of the meadow-birds.  Again<br />
  I trod the forest paths, in shade of trees<br />
  With foliage so tender that the sun<br />
  Shot through the soft, thin leaves its virid sheen,<br />
  As through the emerald waters of the sea.<br />
  The scarlet tanager&mdash;a flake of fire,<br />
  Blown from the tropic heats upon the breath<br />
  That brought the summer&mdash;caught upon a twig,<br />
  Or quenched its glow in some remote recess.<br />
  The springing ferns unfolded at my feet<br />
  Their tan-brown scrolls, the tiny star-flower shone<br />
  Among its leaves; the insects filled the air<br />
  With a monotonous, reedy resonance<br />
  Of whir and hum, and I sat down again<br />
  Upon a bank, to gather violets.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  From dreams of retrospective joy I woke<br />
  At last, to the quick tinkle of a bell.<br />
  My wife had touched it.  She had been asleep,<br />
  And, waking, called me to her side.  The note,<br />
  Familiar as the murmur of her voice,<br />
  For the first time was strange.  Another bell,<br />
  With other music, ran adown the years<br />
  That lay between me and the golden day<br />
  When, up the mountain-path, I followed far<br />
  The lamb that bore it.  All the scene came back<br />
  In a broad flash; and with it came the same<br />
  Strange apprehension of a mighty change&mdash;<br />
  A vague prevision of transition, born<br />
  Of what, I knew not; on what errand sent,<br />
  I could not guess.<br />

  Responsive to the summons, when I heard,<br />
  Repeated in the ear of memory,<br />
  The words my mother spoke to me that day:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "My Paul has climbed the noblest mountain-height<br />
  In all his little world, and gazed on scenes<br />
  As beautiful as rest beneath the sun.<br />
  I trust he will remember all his life<br />
  That, to his best achievement, and the spot<br />
  Closest to heaven his youthful feet have trod,<br />
  He has been guided by a guileless lamb.<br />
  It is an omen which his mother's heart<br />
  Will treasure with her jewels."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had her tongue<br />
  Been moved to prophecy?  Omen of what?&mdash;<br />
  Of a new height of life to be achieved<br />
  By my lamb's leading?  Ay, it seemed like this!<br />
  An answer to a thousand prayers, up-breathed<br />
  By her whom I had lost, repeated long<br />
  By her whom I was losing?  Was it this?<br />
  Thus charged with premonition, when I stepped<br />
  Into the shaded room, my cheeks were pale,<br />
  And every nerve was quivering with the stress<br />
  Of uncontrolled emotion.  Ah! my lamb!<br />
  How white!  How innocent!  My lamb, my lamb!<br />
  Even the scarlet ribbon which adorned<br />
  The lambkin of my chase was at her throat,<br />
  Repeated in a bright geranium-flower!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Loop up the curtains, love!  Let in the light!"<br />
  The words came strong and sweet, as if the life<br />
  From which they breathed were at its tidal flood.<br />
  "Oh! blessed light!" she added, as the sun<br />
  Flamed on the velvet roses of the floor,<br />
  And touched to life the pictures on the wall,<br />
  And smote the dusk with bars of amber.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Paul!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I turned to answer, and beheld a face<br />
  That glowed with a celestial fire like his<br />
  Who talked with God in Sinai.<br />

  "I have been almost home.  I may not tell,<br />
  For language cannot paint, what I have seen.<br />
  The veil was very thin, and I so near,<br />
  I caught the sheen of multitudes, and heard<br />
  Voices that called and answered from afar<br />
  Through spaces inconceivable, and songs<br />
  Whose harmonies responsive surged and sank<br />
  On the attenuate air, till all my soul<br />
  Was thrilled and filled with music, and I prayed<br />
  To be let loose, that I might cast myself<br />
  Upon the mighty tides, and give my life<br />
  To the supernal raptures.  Ay, I prayed<br />
  That death might come, and give me my release<br />
  From this poor clay, and that I might be born<br />
  By its last travail into life."<br />

  "You have been wildly dreaming, and your brain,<br />
  Quickened to strange vagaries by disease,<br />
  Has cheated you.  You must not talk like this:<br />

  While her eyes shone with an unearthly light:<br />
  "You are not wise, my dear, in things like these.<br />
  The vision was as real as yourself;<br />
  And it will not be long before I go<br />
  To mingle in the life that I have seen.<br />
  I know it, dearest, for she told me this."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "She told you this?" I said,&mdash;"Who told you this?<br />
  Did you hold converse with the multitude?"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Not with the multitude," she answered me;<br />
  "But while I gazed upon the throng, and prayed<br />
  That death might loose me, there appeared a group<br />
  Of radiant ones behind the filmy veil<br />
  That hung between us, looking helplessly<br />
  Upon my struggle, but with eyes that beamed<br />
  With love ineffable.  I knew them too&mdash;<br />
  Knew all of them but one&mdash;and she the first<br />
  And sweetest of them all.  Pure as the light<br />
  And beautiful as morning, she advanced;<br />
  And, at her touch, the veil was parted wide,<br />
  While she passed through, and stood beside my bed.<br />
  She took my hand, she kissed my burning cheek,<br />
  And then, in words that calmed my spirit, said:<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Your prayer will soon be answered; but one prayer,<br />
  Breathed many years by you, and many years<br />
  By one you know not, must be answered first.<br />
  You must go back, though for a little time,<br />
  And reap the harvest of a life.  To him<br />
  Whom you and I have loved, say all your heart<br />
  Shall move your lips to speak, and he will hear.<br />
  The strength, the boldness, the persuasive power<br />
  Which you may need for this, shall all be yours;<br />
  For you shall have the ministry of those<br />
  Whom you have seen.  Speak as a dying wife<br />
  Has liberty to speak to him she leaves;<br />
  And tell him this&mdash;that he may know the voice<br />
  That gives you your commission&mdash;tell him this:<br />
  The lamb has slipped the leash by which his hand<br />
  Held her in thrall, and seeks the mountain-height;<br />
  And he, if he reclaim her to his grasp,<br />
  Must follow where she leads, and kneel at last<br />
  Upon the summit by her side.  And more:<br />
  Give him my promise that if he do this,<br />
  He shall receive from that fair altitude<br />
  Such vision of the realm that lies around,<br />
  Cleft by the river of immortal life,<br />
  As shall so lift him from his selfishness,<br />
  And so enlarge his soul, that he shall stand<br />
  Redeemed from all unworthiness, and saved<br />
  To happiness and heaven.'"<br />

  With the strong utterance, in truth, of one<br />
  Inspired from other worlds; while pale and faint,<br />
  I drank her revelations.  Unbelief<br />
  Had given the lie to her abounding faith,<br />
  And held her vision figment of disease,<br />
  Until the message of my mother fell<br />
  Upon my ears.  Then overcome, I wept<br />
  With deep convulsions, rose and walked the room,<br />
  Wrung my clasped hands, and cried with choking voice,<br />
  "My mother!  O! my mother!"<br />

  Come! sit beside me; for my time is short,<br />
  And I have much to say.  What will you do<br />
  When I am gone?  Will the old life of art<br />
  Content you?  Will you fill your waiting time<br />
  With the old dreams of fame and excellence?"<br />

  "Alas!" I answered, "I am done with life:<br />
  My life is dead; and though my hand has won<br />
  All it has striven to win, and all my heart<br />
  In its weak pride has prompted it to seek<br />
  Of love and honor; though success is mine<br />
  In all my eager enterprise, I know<br />
  My life has been a failure.  I am left<br />
  Or shall be left, when you, my love, are gone,<br />
  Without resource&mdash;a hopeless, worthless man,<br />
  Longing to hide his shame and his despair<br />
  Within the grave."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I thank thee, Lord!" she said:<br />
  "So many prayers are answered! ... You knew not<br />
  That I had asked for this.  You did not know<br />
  When you were striving with your feeble might<br />
  For the great prizes that beguiled your pride,<br />
  That at the hand of God I begged success.<br />
  Ay, Paul, I prayed that you might gather all<br />
  The good that you have won, and that, at last,<br />
  You might be brought to know the worthlessncss<br />
  Of every selfish meed, and feel how weak&mdash;<br />
  How worse than helpless&mdash;is the highest man<br />
  Who lives within, and labors to, himself.<br />
  Not one of all the prizes you have gained<br />
  Contains the good that lies in your despair."<br />

  "Teach me," I said, "for I am ignorant;<br />
  Lead me, for I am blind.  Explain the past,<br />

  "You have been hungry all your life for God,<br />
  And known it not.  You lavished first on me<br />
  Your heart's best love.  You poured its treasured wealth<br />
  At an unworthy shrine.  You made a God<br />
  Of poor mortality; and when you learned<br />
  Your love was greater than the one you loved&mdash;<br />
  The one you worshipped&mdash;you invoked the aid<br />
  Of your imagination, to enrich<br />
  Your pampered idol, till at last you bowed<br />
  Before a creature of your thought.  You stole<br />
  From excellence divine the grace and good<br />
  That made me worshipful; and even these<br />
  Palled on your heart at last, and ceased to yield<br />
  The inspiration that you craved.  You pined,<br />
  You starved for something infinitely sweet;<br />
  And still you sought it blindly, wilfully<br />
  In your poor wife,&mdash;sought it, and found it not,<br />
  Through wasted years of life.<br />

  An infinite return.  You asked for more<br />
  Than I could give, although I gave you all<br />
  That woman can bestow on man.  You knew<br />
  You held my constant love, unlimited<br />
  Save by the bounds of mortal tenderness;<br />
  And still you longed for more.  Then sprang your scheme<br />
  For finding in the love of multitudes,<br />
  And in their praise, that which had failed in me.<br />
  You wrote for love and fame, and won them both<br />
  By manly striving&mdash;won and wore them long.<br />
  All good there is in love and praise of men,<br />
  You garnered in your life.  On this reward<br />
  You lived, till you were sated, or until<br />
  You learned it bore no satisfying meed&mdash;<br />
  Learned that the love of many was not more<br />
  Than love of one.  With all my love your own,<br />
  With love and praise of men, your famished soul<br />
  Craved infinite approval&mdash;craved a love<br />
  Beyond the love of woman and of man.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Then with new hope, you apotheosized<br />
  Your cherished art, and sought for excellence<br />
  And for your own approval; with what end,<br />
  Your helplessness informs me.  You essayed<br />
  The revelation of the mighty forms<br />
  That dwell in the unrealized.  You sought<br />
  To shape your best ideals, and to find<br />
  In the grand scheme your motive and reward.<br />
  All this blind reaching after excellence,<br />
  Was but the reaching of your soul for God.<br />
  Imagination could not touch the height;<br />
  And you were baffled.  So, you failed to find<br />
  The God your spirit yearned for in your art,<br />
  And failed of self-approval.<br />

  But one resource,&mdash;you are shut up to this:<br />
  You must bow down and worship God; and give<br />
  Your heart to him, accept his love for you,<br />
  And feast your soul on excellence in him.<br />
  So, a new life shall open to your feet,<br />
  Strown richly with rewards; and when your steps<br />
  Shall reach the river, I will wait for you<br />
  Upon the other shore, and we shall be<br />
  One in the life immortal as in this.<br />
  O!  Paul! your time is now.  I cannot die<br />

  Await me yonder, with the consciousness<br />

  Upon its track.  I learned where she had found<br />
  Her peaceful joy, her satisfying good,<br />
  And where, in my rebellious pride of heart,<br />
  Mine had been lost.  She, by an instinct sure,<br />
  Or by the grace of Heaven, had in her youth,<br />
  Though sorely chastened, given herself to God<br />
  And through a life of saintly purity&mdash;<br />
  A life of love to me and love to all&mdash;<br />
  Had feasted at the fountain of all love.<br />
  Had worshipped at the Excellence Divine,<br />
  And only waited for my last adieu<br />

  I knew not how to speak, or what to do.<br />
  She looked at me expectant; while a thrill<br />
  Of terror shot through all my frame.<br />

  At this, the door was opened silently,<br />
  And our dear daughter stood within the room.<br />
  Alarmed at vision of the sudden change<br />
  That death had wrought upon her mother's face,<br />
  She hastened to her side, and kneeling there,<br />
  Bowed on her breast with tears and choking sobs,<br />
  Her heart too full for speech.<br />

  The dying mother said, resting her hand<br />
  Upon her daughter's head.  "Be silent, dear!<br />
  Your father kneels to pray.  Make room for him,<br />
  That he may kneel beside you."<br />

  I felt the presence of her heavenly friends,<br />
  And knew that there were spirits in the room.<br />
  I did not doubt, nor have I doubted since,<br />
  That there were loving witnesses of all<br />
  The scenes enacted round that hallowed bed.<br />
  Ay, and they spoke.  Deep in the innermost<br />
  I heard the tender words, "O! kneel my son!&mdash;"<br />
  A sweet monition from my mother's lips.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Kneel! kneel!"  It was the echo of a throng.<br />

  That rustled at the window, in the airs<br />
  That moved with conscious pulse to passing wings,<br />
  Came the same burden "Kneel!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Kneel! kneel!  O! kneel!"<br />
  In tones of earnest pleading, came from lips<br />

  "O!  God!" I said, "be merciful to me<br />
  A reprobate!  I have blasphemed thy name.<br />
  Abused thy patient love, and held from thee<br />
  My heart and life; and now, in my extreme<br />
  Of need and of despair, I come to thee.<br />
  O! cast me not away, for here, at last,<br />
  After a life of selfishness and sin,<br />
  I yield my will to thine, and pledge my soul&mdash;<br />
  All that I am, all I can ever be&mdash;<br />
  Supremely to thy service.  I renounce<br />
  All worldly aims, all selfish enterprise.<br />
  And dedicate the remnant of my power<br />
  To thee and those thou lovest.  Comfort me!<br />
  O! come and comfort me, for I despair!<br />
  Give me thy peace, for I am rent and tossed!<br />
  Feed me with love, else I shall die of want!<br />
  Behold!  I empty out my worthlessncss,<br />
  And beg thee to come in, and fill my soul<br />
  With thy rich presence.  I adore thy love;<br />
  I seek for thy approval; I bow down,<br />
  And worship thee, the Excellence Supreme.<br />
  I've tasted of the sweetest that the world<br />
  Can give to me; and human love and praise.<br />
  And all of excellence within the scope<br />
  Of my conception, and my power to reach<br />
  And realize in highest forms of art,<br />
  Have left me hungry, thirsty lor thyself.<br />
  O! feed and fire me!  Fill and furnish me!<br />
  And if thou hast for me some humble task&mdash;<br />
  Some service for thyself, or for thy own&mdash;<br />
  Reveal it to thy sad, repentant child,<br />
  Or use him as thy willing instrument.<br />

  I raised my head at last, and met the eyes<br />
  Bright with the light of death, and with the dawn<br />

  Of an immortal,&mdash;full of faith and love&mdash;<br />

  On which a throbbing song-bird clings, and pours<br />
  His sweet incontinence of ecstasy,<br />
  And then in broken whispers said to me:<br />
  "Do you not hear them?  They have caught the news,<br />
  And all the sky is ringing with their song<br />
  Of gladness and of welcome.  '<i>Paul is saved</i>!<br />
  <i>Paul is redeemed and saved!</i>' I hear them cry;<br />
  And myriad voices catch the new delight,<br />
  And carry the acclaim, till heaven itself<br />
  Sends back the happy echo: '<i>Paul is saved.</i>'"<br />

<p class="poem">
  She stretched her hands, and took me to her breast.<br />
  I kissed her, blessed her, spoke my last adieu,<br />
  And yielded place to her whom God had given<br />
  To be our child.  After a long embrace.<br />
  She whispered: "I am weary; let me sleep!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  She passed to peaceful slumber like a child,<br />
  The while attendant angels built the dream<br />
  On which she rode to heaven.  Not once again<br />
  She spoke to mortal ears, but slept and smiled,<br />
  And slept and smiled again, till daylight passed.<br />
  The night came down; the long hours lapsed away;<br />
  The city sounds grew fainter, till at last<br />
  We sat alone with silence and with death.<br />
  At the first blush of morning she looked up,<br />
  And spoke, but not to us: "I'm coming now!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I sought the window, to relieve the pain<br />
  Of long suppressed emotion.  In the East,<br />
  Tinged with the golden dawn, the morning star<br />
  Was blazing in its glory, while beneath,<br />
  The slender moon, at its last rising, hung,<br />
  Paling and dying in the growing light,<br />
  And passing with that leading up to heaven.<br />
  My daughter stood beside her mother's bed,<br />
  But I had better vision of the scene<br />
  In the sweet symbol God had hung for me<br />
  Upon the sky.<br />

  And higher rose, and still more faintly shone,<br />
  The star-led moon.  Then, as it faded out,<br />
  Quenched by prevailing day, I heard one sigh<br />
  A sigh so charged with pathos of deep joy,<br />
  And peace ineffable, that memory<br />
  Can never lose the sound; and all was past!<br />
  The peaceful summer-day that rose upon<br />
  This night of trial and this morn of grief,<br />
  Rose not with calmer light than that which dawned<br />
  Upon my spirit.  Chastened, bowed, subdued,<br />
  I kissed the rod that smote me, and exclaimed:<br />
  "The Lord hath given; the Lord hath taken away<br />
  And blessed be his name!"<br />

  I grieved, and still I grieve; but with a heart<br />
  At peace with God, and soft with sympathy<br />
  Toward all my sorrowing, struggling, sinful race.<br />
  My hope, that clung so fondly to the world<br />
  And the rewards of time, an anchor sure<br />
  Now grasps the Eternal Rock within the veil<br />
  Of troubled waters.  Storms may wrench and toss,<br />
  And tides may swing me, in their ebb and flow,<br />
  But I shall not be moved.<br />

  Upon the grave that holds her sacred dust.<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
